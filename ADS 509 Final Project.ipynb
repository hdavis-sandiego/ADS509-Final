    "#### Causes include\n",
    "\n",
    "ELECTRICAL - Accidents in which electric current is most directly responsible for the resulting accident.\n",
    "\n",
    "ENTRAPMENT - In accidents involving no injuries or nonfatal injuries which are not serious, entrapment of mine workers takes precedence over roof falls, explosives accidents, inundations, etc. If a roof fall results in an entrapment accident, the accident classification is ï¿½Entrapment.\n",
    "\n",
    "EXPLODING VESSELS UNDER PRESSURE - These are accidents caused by explosion of air hoses, air tanks, hydraulic lines, hydraulic hoses, and other accidents precipitated by exploding vessels.\n",
    "\n",
    "EXPLOSIVES AND BREAKING AGENTS - Accidents involving the detonation of manufactured explosives, Airdox, or Cardox, that can cause flying debris, concussive forces, or fumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "FALLING, ROLLING, OR SLIDING ROCK OR MATERIAL OF ANY KIND -Injuries caused directly by falling material require great care in classification. Remember that it is the accident we want to classify. If material was set in motion by machinery, haulage equipment, or hand tools, or while material is being handled or disturbed, etc., charge the force that set the material in motion. For example, where a rock was pushed over a highwall by a dozer and the rock hit another rock which struck and injured a worker - charge the accident to the dozer. Charge the accident to that which most directly caused the resulting accident. Without the dozer, there would have been no resulting accident. This includes accidents caused by improper blocking of equipment under repair or inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "FALL OF FACE, RIB, SIDE OR HIGHWALL - Accidents in this classification include falls of material (from in-place) while barring down or placing props; also pressure bumps and bursts. Since pressure bumps and bursts which cause accidents are infrequent, they are not given a separate category. Not included are accidents in which the motion of machinery or haulage equipment caused the fall either directly or by knocking out support; such accidents are classified as machinery or haulage, whichever is appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "FALL OF ROOF OR BACK - Underground accidents which include falls while barring down or placing props; also pressure bumps and bursts. Not included are accidents in which the motion of machinery or haulage equipment caused the fall either directly or by knocking out support; such falls are classified as machinery or haulage, whichever is appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "FIRE - In underground mines, an unplanned fire not extinguished within 10 minutes of discovery; in surface mines and surface areas of underground mines, an unplanned fire not extinguished within 30 minutes of discovery;\n",
    "\n",
    "HANDLING MATERIAL - (Lifting, pulling, pushing, shoveling material.) The material may be in bags or boxes, or loose sand, coal, rock, timber, etc. The accident must have been most directly caused by handling material.\n",
    "\n",
    "HAND TOOLS - Accidents related to non-powered tools when being used as hand tools. Do not include electric tools or air-powered tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "HOISTING - Damage to hoisting equipment in a shaft or slope which endangers an individual or interferes with use of the equipment for more than 30 minutes. Hoisting may also be the classification where a victim was injured by hoisting equipment but there was no damage to the equipment. Accidents involving cages, skips, buckets, or elevators. The accident results from the action, motion, or failure of the hoisting equipment or mechanism. Included is equipment such as derricks and cranes only when used in shaft sinking; suspended work platforms in shafts; mine cars being lowered or raised by hoisting equipment on slopes or inclines; a skip squeezed between timbers resulting in an accident; or an ore bucket tipped for any reason causing an accident.\n",
    "\n",
    "IGNITION OR EXPLOSION OF GAS OR DUST - Accidents resulting as a consequence of the ignition or explosion of gas or dust. Included are exploding gasoline vapors, space heaters, or furnaces.\n",
    "Methane Ignition - A methane ignition occurs when methane burns without producing destructive forces. Damage resulting from an ignition is limited to that caused by flame and heat. Personnel in the immediate vicinity of an ignition may be burned and line brattice or other materials in close proximity may be discolored, melted or burned. Ignitions generally involve small quantities of methane and are usually confined to a small area; however, in the case of methane roof layering, flame spread may be more extensive.\n",
    "Methane Explosion - A methane explosion occurs when methane is ignited and burns violently. The flame of the explosion accelerates rapidly, heating the environment and causing destructive forces. Evidence of the destructive forces may be manifest on victims, equipment, structures, etc. Witnesses to an explosion may hear the noise generated by the resulting sound pressure wave.\n",
    "\n",
    "IMPOUNDMENT - An unstable condition at an impoundment, refuse pile, or culm bank which requires emergency action in order to prevent failure, or which causes individuals to evacuate an area. Also the failure of an impoundment, refuse pile, or culm bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "INUNDATION - An unplanned inundation of a mine by a liquid or gas. The mine may be either a surface or underground operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "MACHINERY - Accidents that result from the action or motion of machinery or from failure of component parts. Included are all electric and air-powered tools and mining machinery such as drills, tuggers, slushers, draglines, power shovels, loading machines, compressors, etc. Include derricks and cranes except when they are used in shaft sinking (see HOISTING) or mobile cranes traveling with a load (see POWERED HAULAGE).\n",
    "\n",
    "NON-POWERED HAULAGE - Accidents related to motion of non-powered haulage equipment. Included are accidents involving wheelbarrows, manually pushed mine cars and trucks, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "POWERED HAULAGE - Haulage includes motors and rail cars, conveyors, belt feeders, longwall conveyors, bucket elevators, vertical manlifts, self-loading scrapers or pans, shuttle cars, haulage trucks, front-end loaders, load-haul- dumps, forklifts, cherry pickers, mobile cranes if traveling with a load, etc. The accident is caused by the motion of the haulage unit. Include accidents that are caused by an energized or moving unit or failure of component parts. If a car dropper suffers an injury as a result of falling from a moving car, charge the accident to haulage.\n",
    "\n",
    "SLIP OR FALL OF PERSON - Includes slips or falls from an elevated position or at the same level while getting on or off machinery or haulage equipment that is not moving. Also includes slips or falls while servicing or repairing equipment or machinery. Includes stepping in a hole.\n",
    "\n",
    "STEPPING OR KNEELING ON OBJECT - Accidents are classified in this category only where the object stepped or kneeled on contributed most directly to the accident.\n",
    "\n",
    "STRIKING OR BUMPING - This classification is restricted to those accidents in which an individual, while moving about, strikes or bumps an object but is not handling material, using hand tools, or operating equipment.\n",
    "\n",
    "OTHER - Accidents not elsewhere classified. This is a last resort category."

injured on december   when he was struck by a large piece of frozen conglomerated material that rolled from the top of a muckpile the victim was examining the muckpile face to determine the location of the orewaste contact point the accident occurred because management failed to establish procedures requiring muckpiles to be trimmed before persons performed any work at the muckpile faces general information red dog mine a surface lead and zinc mine operated by teck cominco alaska inc was located in kotzebue norwest arctic county alaska the principal operating officials were david thompson president and doug horswill vice president the mine was normally operated two  hour shifts a day  days per week total employment was  persons lead and zinc ore was drilled blasted and removed from a multiple bench pit the ore was crushed and conveyed to the mill grinding and sulphide flotation circuit to produce zinc and lead concentrates the concentrate was trucked to a port the finished products were shipped and sold to commercial industries the last regular inspection at this operation was completed on november   description of accident on the day of the accident jeffrey huber victim began his normal shift at  am about  am he reported to the mine office for the daily staff meeting at approximately  am huber drove a pickup truck to the  level muckpile in the pit to examine the muckpile face and identify the orewaste contact points before entering the muckpile area he made radio contact with josh rutman frontend loader operator who backed away about  feet before he resumed removing material huber commenced his muckpile examinations and each time he entered the muckpile area he first contacted rutman on the radio this activity proceeded without incident until about  am at that time rutman had moved his loader to another location while huber again examined the face of the muckpile rutman looked to his left while backing out of the face and saw huber pinned under frozen material he immediately called for medical assistance mine personnel responded treated the victim and transported him to the site medical clinic where he was pronounced dead by the resident physician assistant the cause of death was attributed to multiple trauma investigation of accident msha was notified of the accident at  am on december   by a telephone call from john knapp general manager to mshas emergency hotline rodney gust mine safety and health specialist was notified and an investigation was started the same day an order was issued to ensure the safety of the miners under the provisions of section k of the mine act mshas accident investigator traveled to the mine conducted a physical inspection of the accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management employees and the miners representative discussion location the accident occurred in the pit at the  level muckpile muckpile face the muckpile was approximately  feet high and  feet wide it was composed of frozen conglomerated material that had been blasted on november th the bench area was level and frozen light plants were provided for additional visibility the material that struck the victim was about  ï¿½ feet long x  ï¿½ feet wide x  ï¿½ feet thick and weighed approximately  tons muckpile examination procedures after each blast a geologist would examine the top of the muck pile and position stakes to delineate the orewaste contact point the crew would muck the blasted rock until a stake was encountered then the frontend loader operator would call for the geologist to examine the muckpile face to ensure ore was loaded rather than waste rock the past practice was that the geologist would walk to the toe of the face and visually examine the material and inform the loader operator regarding the location of the ore weather conditions the weather on the day of the accident was clear with a slight wind and a temperature of  degrees fahrenheit the temperature caused the blasted material to freeze together this resulted in the formation of a large mass of conglomerated material that was positioned near the top of the face training and experience jeffrey huber had  years and  months of total mining experience he had worked  yrs and  months at this mine as a geologist and during this period his duties included examining muckpile face areas he had received training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following root cause was identified root cause management policies and controls were inadequate there were no procedures requiring muckpiles to be trimmed to prevent hazards to persons and ensure that miners could safely examine muckpiles while standing near the face management failed to identify the blasted chunks of frozen material near the top of the muck pile as a potential hazard corrective action management should establish formalized policies and procedures that require muckpiles to be trimmed to prevent hazards to persons and ensure that examinations of muckpiles can be conducted safely conclusion the accident occurred because the muckpile face was not trimmed to prevent hazards to persons required to work or travel in that area enforcement action order no  was issued on december   under the provisions of section k of the mine act a fatal accident occurred at this mine on december   when a miner geologist was taking samples of a muckpile between the ore and waste material this order is issued to ensure the safety of all persons at this operation it prohibits all activity at the  face level until msha has determined that it is safe to resume normal mining operations in the area the mine operator shall obtain prior approval from an authorized representative for all actions to recover andor restore operations to the affected area

that the exhaust fan shaft of the no  raymond coal mill had faulty bearings burton and ray sessor maintenance supervisor traveled to the no  coal mill to assess the situation and determine what tools and equipment would be needed to complete the job burton traveled to the maintenance shop and cut a section of schedule steel pipe to use in conjunction with an electric portapower unit and a power team hydraulic ram an exhaust fan was removed from the shaft and a new shaft with the bearings pressed in place was installed to install the fan onto the shaft a portapower was used to power the hydraulic ram to apply force to the fan for installation onto the shaft the steel pipe was placed against the south concrete wall and used in conjunction with several metal spacers at least three attempts were made to push the fan onto the shaft prior to the accident about  pm it was discovered that an additional ï¿½ inch was needed to complete the job burton informed steven baker environmental engineer who was operating the portapower that he needed one more push as the power was being supplied to the hydraulic ram the pipe kicked out striking burton delbert collins maintenance worker positioned on the west side of the fan immediately behind burton received minor injuries coworkers immediately attended to burton however they were unable to detect any vital signs

the provisions of section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners mshas accident investigation team traveled to the mine conducted a physical investigation of the accident site interviewed employees and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management employees miners representative and the virginia division of mineral mining discussion location of the accident the accident occurred at the no  raymond coal mill the exhaust fan was located in the corner of the lower level of the surface lime processing plant the nearby concrete wall of the building was located perpendicular to the floor and parallel to the fan the fan shaft and bearings were mounted in a cylindrical housing on top of a concrete pylon the shaft was perpendicular to the concrete wall the concrete wall was used as the primary support for the portable ram the company reportedly used a similar ram arrangement in the past when installing the fan onto the shaft evidence of concrete chipping was present by the location of marks in the wall where the supports were previously used to push the fan onto the shaft fan and shaft design the inch diameter fan was designed to have a slight press fit to hold the fan tight on the shaft a keyway square key stock and socket head setscrews were also used to secure the fan on the shaft once the fan was installed onto the shaft a spanner nut was installed onto the threaded shaft end to complete the fan installation this fan normally required the application of heat along with the ram when removing or installing the fan onto the shaft hydraulic ram the hydraulic ram was a single acting hydraulic cylinder that used pressure to extend the cylinder and an internal spring to retract the cylinder the body of the ram was fabricated from aluminum making for a lightweight and portable unit the ram was rated for  tons with a  ï¿½ inch stroke a portable electrically driven hydraulic pump was used to supply oil pressure and flow to the hydraulic cylinder or ram the pump unit had a flip lever to either supply oil pressure to extend the ram or to relieve pressure for the spring to retract the ram an electrical pendent control on the end of a portable power cable connected to the pump could be used to remotely control the pump unit a hydraulic pressure gauge was located on the pump unit to indicate the system ram pressure during use a hydraulic hose was used to connect the pump to the ram ram support components metal components plates and pipes were used to provide support for the ram during the installation of the fan the limited ram stroke fan location and configuration of the fan shaft required the use of two different support arrangements to install the fan the arrangement of the supports of the first press attempts were a piece of steel bar stock placed against the concrete wall to provide a flat surface over the chipped area a piece of saw cut schedule  steel pipe temporarily supported by a step ladder the ram unit with the body against the pipe end and a cross block from a bearing puller a ton ram supported by a steel plate against the mill structure was also used to support the shaft and bearings to help prevent the damage of the newly installed shaft bearings the arrangement would only permit the fan to be installed to the point where the cross block would make contact with the end of the fan shaft the arrangement of the supports of the later press attempts was the same as the first attempts with the addition of an inner bearing race from a discarded bearing assembly the bar stock measured  inches long   inches wide and  inch thick the steel pipe measured  inches long and ï¿½ inches in diameter and the bearing puller measured  inches by ï¿½ inches after multiple attempts to install the fan completely a maintenance worker noticed that the fan hub was not fully seated against the shoulder on the shaft a final attempt to fully seat the fan using the second setup resulted with the arrangement becoming dislodged condition of pressing components the conditions of the components used to install the fan were visually inspected the bar stock used between the concrete wall and the pipe the pipe and the steel plate used to support the  ton ram were all bent and deformed indicating that a large load was imposed during the fan installation attempts reportedly the three deformed components were relatively straight prior to the multiple fan installation attempts the portable electrically powered hydraulic pump units appeared intact with no physical damage both hydraulic rams appeared to be intact with no visible oil leaks or damage based on design calculations performed according to the american institute of steel construction aisc manual of steel construction load and resistance factor design the subject pipe involved in the accident has an approximate design compression strength limit of  tons the ton ram was capable of producing a force in excess of the  ton capacity of the subject pipe training burton had a total of  years mining experience  years as a mechanic he had received training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following causal factors were identified causal factor policies standards and controls were inadequate the company had not developed safe work procedures to support the portapower and hydraulic ram in conjunction with a steel pipe and combination of spacers the task could not be performed safely because the pressure applied by the ram exceeded the designed capacity of the pipe corrective action conduct a thorough risk assessment before starting a task to ensure that all hazards are evaluated and eliminated management should develop and implement procedures that ensure repairs to the coal mill do not expose miners to hazards causal factor none of the components were assembled or supported on a stable base miners were required to manually support the components during the installation process corrective action develop and implement a standard procedure that uses the safety features recommended by the manufacturer to ensure the equipment is properly blocked secured and utilized conclusion the accident was caused by the failure to evaluate the work procedures identify all possible hazards and establish safe procedures to install the fan housing the steel pipe was used beyond the designed capacity intended because the force applied bent the pipe causing it to kick out the use of the pipe to support the amount of force the hydraulic ram exerted on it was not within the pipes designed capacity enforcement action chemical lime company of virginia inc order no  was issued on april   under the provisions of section k of the mine act a fatal accident occurred at this operation on april   when the mechanic was struck in the head while attempting to replace the fan on the no  raymond coal mill shaft this order was issued to assure the safety of all persons at this operation it prohibits all activity at the no  raymond coal mill until msha has determined

provision of section a of the mine act for a violation of  cfr  a maintenance mechanic was fatally injured at this operation on april   when he was struck by a  feet inch long  ï¿½ inch diameter section of pipe the victim and coworker were using a ton power team hydraulic ram to push the exhaust fan blade assembly onto the shaft of the no  coal mill the ram was placed in a horizontal position between the fan blade assembly and a pipe and a piece of steel bar stock ultimately braced against a concrete wall when the hydraulic ram was energized for the purpose of moving the exhaust fan it also exerted force on the support pipe causing it to bend and then kick out with great force and it struck the victim the use of the pipe to support the amount of force the hydraulic ram exerted on it during reassembly of the exhaust fan was not within the pipes design capacity this citation was terminated on april   the mine operator has submitted a plan to msha stating that a pipe will no longer

contracted by holcim to clean various areas throughout the plant thompson was located at  progress street sumter county south carolina the principal operating official was david oliver ii site supervisor the contractor normally worked one hour shift a day  days a week total employment was  persons at this site the victim worked for thompson environmental services llc sanitech was also contracted by holcim to clean various areas in the plant sanitech was located at  bainbridge avenue charleston charleston county south carolina the principal operating official was ron dewitt environmental sales representative the contractor normally worked one hour shift a day five days a week total employment was seven persons at this site on january   contracting crews from thompson and sanitech started work at holcim to clean accumulations of material in the roller mill the mill had been shut down the previous day to enable the contractors to enter the mill to vacuum and pick up material in and around the grinding table before starting to work employees for both contractors at the site on the morning of january   received site specific hazard training which included training in the hazards of hot material piles however bell arrived at the site later in the morning and did not attend this training session the last regular inspection at this operation was completed on december   description of accident on the day of the accident kenneth l bell jr victim reported to work at approximately  am he and four other coworkers attended a safety meetingtraining session on confined spaces after the meeting bell felix quaye and joey ellington laborers were assigned to vacuum material from underneath the roller mill table they positioned the vacuum truck and extended a rigid pipe through an inspection door next to the bucket elevator on the eastern side of the roller mill approximately  feet of flexible inch hose was connected to the rigid pipe to facilitate vacuuming at  am after posting the entry permit and putting their lock in place to identify that workers were present in the confined space they entered the work area bell placed oversized material fist to softballsize chunks in fivegallon plastic buckets while quaye and ellington vacuumed raw material as bell filled the buckets he passed them through one of six roller mill hot gas inlet ports out into the adjacent hot gas supply duct to robert young service technician with holcim or to one of three sanitech employees contracted to assist with the clean up the buckets were emptied through an inspection door to a hopper located outside at  noon bell quaye and ellington signed out on the confined space permit for lunch at  pm james edwards laborer for thompson replaced ellington and the three resumed cleaning the area work continued until about  pm when edwards noticed bell was missing he notified leander weston lead man for thompson edwards and quaye continued working while weston looked for bell at about  pm weston notified david oliver site supervisor for thompson that bell was missing and that he was unable to find him weston obtained a flashlight and he quaye and edwards began searching for bell they looked around the table and entered one of the hot gas supply ducts after traveling about  feet they reached the base of a buildup of hot material which sloped upward and extended from underneath the hot gas generator toward the louvered damper standing at the wye in the duct work they pointed a flashlight toward the damper and found bell buried up to his waist in the hot material edwards immediately went back to the roller mill and summoned help employees reached bell by using wooden boards placed on top of the hot material pile to distribute their weight shovels and a rope were used to recover bell the county coroner arrived and pronounced bell dead at the scene as a result of asphyxia and thermal burns investigation of the accident msha was notified of the accident at  pm on january   by a telephone call from john jerrels human resources representative for holcim to harry l verdier assistant district manager an investigation was started that day an order was issued under the provisions of section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners mshas accident investigators traveled to the mine made a physical inspection of the accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and employees discussion location of the accident the accident occurred in a hot gas supply duct underneath the hot gas generator about  feet from the victims assigned work area a pile of hot material had accumulated in a transition zone of the duct the buildup of material consisted mainly of partially calcined limestone dust that had been entrained in the hot gas flow from the kiln preheater tower when the dustladen gas flow entered the ducts transition zone after passing through the louvered damper the increased crosssectional area caused the velocity of the gas flow to decrease this combined with the turbulent gas flow patterns induced by the hot gas generator caused some of the entrained dust to settle out of suspension in the bottom of the duct this dust remained loose and did not pack at its deepest point located directly under the hot gas generator the material pile accumulated to a depth of about ï¿½ feet sloping down to a  to  inch layer where the ductwork wyed into two ducts this to inch layer generally covered the bottom of both ducts that supplied hot gas flow to the northern and southern sides of the roller mill the ramplike sloped profile under the hot gas generator was shaped by high velocity gases flowing in the duct during operation gases from the hot gas generator entered and merged with lateral flow from the kiln preheater forming and maintaining the slope the base of the sloped material at the eastern end of the pile was packed enough by the action of the merging gas streams to permit a person to walk up the slope in addition some light cementitious crusting developed on the surface of the pile as it cooled and drew some moisture from the air the transition zone of the duct was insulated with refractory material on its inside perimeter this combined with the selfinsulating nature of the material kept the mass very hot below the surface the pile could have been as hot as the ï¿½c ï¿½f gas stream that flowed through the duct under normal operations in the four days that the operation had been shut down minimal cooling had occurred deep inside the pile of material where temperatures at the time of the accident were estimated to be several hundred degrees fahrenheit weather weather on the day of the accident was overcast and cold roller mill process the roller mill model  was manufactured by polysius corporation the mill incorporated grinding drying and high efficiency separation of the raw feed with an output of up to  tonshr the material entering the mill contained approximately  percent moisture and the ground material exiting the raw mill contained less than  percent moisture the majority of the product leaving the mill was finer than  microns this material was transported above by hot gases emerging from under the grinding table and the raw mill hot gas inlet ducts to a dynamic separator above the grinding table the separator allowed finished material to be transported with the airflow to the main bag house oversized material both coarse dust and chunks could not be transported by the hot gas stream this material fell through the nozzle ring and was returned to the mill feed inlet via the table scraper and recirculating bucket elevator the roller mill was part of a plant modernization project that was completed in  at the time of the accident it was shut down for scheduled maintenance the new plant had been in operation for approximately  months since then two previous maintenance shutdowns had occurred during one of these shutdowns a similar accumulation of hot material was removed from the duct area underneath the hot gas generator raw mill inlet duct the airflow used to dry and transport material at the roller mill was supplied by the kiln system and supplemented by the hot gas generator airflow was drawn from the preheater section of the kiln system through an induced draft id fan manufactured by robinson corporation and forced through ductwork designated as the raw mill inlet duct the airflow entered louvered dampers inside the ductwork located on the western side of the roller mill a portion of the airflow was directed through suitable ducting to the coal bins the remaining airflow joined with the airflow from the hot gas generator the total airflow was split horizontally as the ductworks wyed into two smaller ducts that approached the northern and southern sides of the roller mill hot gases were directed to six openings three from each duct below the grinding table then up through the nozzle ring contractors two contracting crews were scheduled to work in the roller mill to clean up material from the roller mill grinding table and to remove preheater dust accumulations from the roller mill hot gas supply ducts thompson was contracted to remove raw material accumulations and oversized raw material chunks from the scraper area under the roller mill grinding table and from six adjacent roller mill hot gas inlet ports sanitech employees were assigned with holcim employee robert young to remove oversized material from the roller mill hot gas supply ducts illumination there were four sources of illumination in the hot gas supply duct electric lights were used by sanitech to illuminate the east end of the hot gas supply duct closest to the roller mill the duct inspection door through which oversized material was being removed from the work areas was located at the western extremity of sanitechs assigned work area approximately  feet from the roller mill table area where the victim was assigned this inspection door was open admitting direct light from outside a tempering air damper was located in the top of the duct on the eastern side of the hot gas generator inlet duct and directly above the base of the material pile this damper was open admitting indirect light from outside an inspection door in the south side wall of the duct close to the louvered damper had been removed admitting direct light from outside in addition the offwhite color of the dust reflected the light that entered from outside visibility was adequate even with only a limited amount of outside light shining through the openings in the inspection doors vacuum truck the vehicle operated by thompson employees to remove material under the roller mill was manufactured by sterling truck corporation in august  it had a gross vehicle weight rating of  pounds the truck was equipped with a supersuckerï¿½ vacuum system manufactured by super products incorporated a inch flexible hose was connected at the truck inlet to a rigid inch diameter pipe approximately  feet long the rigid pipe extended through an inspection door next to the bucket elevator on the eastern side of the roller mill approximately  feet of flexible inch diameter hose was found connected to the rigid pipe underneath the grinding table the open end was found extended into the roller mill hot gas inlet ductwork training and experience on january   holcim conducted maintenance and site specific hazard awareness training prior to the contractors starting clean up operations however bell was not present because he had been assigned to another job at a different industrial facility early that morning bell and two other thompson employees were reassigned to work at the holcim facility bell did not receive site specific hazard awareness training prior to being exposed to mine hazards hardhat sticker holcims policy and procedure to determine if contractor employees received site specific hazard awareness training required contractors to display a sticker on their hardhat the hardhat stickers showed serial numbers assigned sequentially to individual contractor employees the employees name training date and assigned sticker serial number were recorded by mine staff no training records were provided to indicate that bell received the required training root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following causal factors were identified causal factor the management system lacked depth in that a risk assessment to determine possible hazards such as accumulations of hot material in the hot gas supply duct was not conducted prior to assigning contractors to perform work corrective action procedures should be implemented that require risk assessments to be conducted that identify potential hazards in areas adjacent to assigned work areas barricades should be erected to prohibit access to areas where hazards may exist causal factor the required site specific hazard awareness training was not given to the victim before he was assigned to perform tasks he worked for four consecutive days without the required training corrective action written policy and procedures should be established to ensure that all persons have received all of the required training any potential hazards associated with their tasks or work area should be thoroughly addressed causal factor managements oversight of the contractors work practices lacked depth in that the victim left his assigned work area and was unable to be located for several hours the victim was not aware of the hazards associated with accumulations of hot material in the hot gas supply ducts and became entrapped corrective action procedures should be established to ensure that all contractor employees understand any potential hazards associated with their assignments management should implement procedures to monitor contractors to continually reassess work progress conclusion the accident occurred because the victim was untrained in the hazards associated with the cement manufacturing process he left his assigned work area and went into a hot gas supply duct barricades or warning signs were not posted to prevent entry at all approaches to the hot material in the hot gas supply duct violations holcim us inc order no  was issued on january   under the provisions of section k of the mine act a fatal accident occurred at this operation on january   a contractor employee who was working with a clean up crew under the table of the raw mill entered a large horizontal duct between the preheater and the raw mill and became trapped to the waist in preheater dust this order is issued to assure the safety of all persons at this operation it prohibits activity in the raw mill inlet duct between the kiln id fan and the raw mill until msha has determined that it is safe to resume normal mining operations in this area the mine operator shall obtain prior approval from an authorized representative for all actions to recover andor restore operations to the affected area this order was terminated on february   conditions that contributed to the accident have been corrected and normal operations can resume citation no  was issued on march   under the provisions of section a of the mine act for a violation of  cfr a a contract employee was fatally injured at this operation on january   when an accumulation of hot material that he walked on unexpectedly gave way burying him above the waist the victim had left his assigned work area and entered the hot gas supply duct the mine operator failed to ensure that the victim had received site

operating the track loader on the edge of the secondary road approximately  feet from the intersection of the access road while the victim was operating the track loader he came too close to the edge of the road and lost control of the equipment the track loader traveled approximately  feet down a  grade and continued to travel another  feet onto the lower section of the secondary road which spiraled down the mountain track loader the track loader involved in the accident was a caterpillar model c series ii tracktype loader manufactured in  it had an operating weight of  pounds and was equipped with a caterpillar model  four cylinder diesel engine the track loader was damaged in the accident the right side near the operators compartment and the left step for access to the operators compartment were dented the rollover protective structure rops was intact but damaged there was a  ï¿½ inch dent in front of the operators compartment four access handles attached to the rops vertical beams were bent the hydraulic pump for the bucket was cracked bucket control the bucket was hydraulically controlled from levers located to the right of the operators seat the bucket was tested by raising and lowering it and functioned as designed after this test the cracked left hydraulic pump failed and no further tests were performed on the bucket operation all other operational tests were conducted with the bucket raised and secured steering control the steering control consisted of two steering clutches and two bandtype brakes that were mechanically applied and spring released the steering controls were operated by two steering clutchbrake control pedals the left and right pedals controlled the respective steering clutch and brake the rate of steering was controlled by how far the pedal was pushed down depressing the pedal partially disengaged the clutch for a slow turn and fully depressing it engaged the brake for a sharper turn the clutch and brake units were located in the drive assembly for each side of the machine the steering controls were tested to verify left and right turns in both forward and reverse directions and functioned as designed service and park brake controls the service and park brake consisted of the same two bandtype brakes mechanically applied and spring released as used for the steering control these brake units were located in the drive assembly for each side of the machine a single service brake pedal was located between the two steering control pedals when depressed this pedal activated both brakes simultaneously without disengaging the steering clutches depressing the service brake pedal engaged the brakes and releasing the service brake disengaged the brakes the parking brake switch was located on the control panel to engage the parking brake this switch had to be flipped downward and the center service brake pedal pushed down until the pedal stopped the pedal remained in the depressed position to release the park brake the operator pushed the center service brake pedal down and flipped the brake switch upward the service and parking brakes were tested in forward and reverse and functioned as designed transmission controls the transmission had three speeds forward and three speeds in reverse the transmission was controlled by a tshaped shift level located to the left of the operators seat the control had a ushaped shift pattern one side of the ushaped shift pattern controlled the forward speeds and the other side controlled the reverse speeds moving the shift control from side to side on the ushaped shift pattern shifted the transmission between forward and reverse the transmission was in neutral when the shifter was at the bottom between the sides of the ushaped shift pattern the shift lever was connected by mechanical linkages to the shift controls mounted on the transmission the transmission was tested and functioned as designed in forward and reverse directions governor

accident and recovery the hydraulic lines for the steering and braking systems were intact and only repairs to a few air components that appeared to be damaged in the accident andor recovery of the truck were required to functionally test the braking systems a functional seat belt was present in both the operators side and passengers side seating positions braking system the truck had a dualcircuit air over hydraulic service brake system one circuit for the steering axle service brakes and one circuit for the drive axle service brakes it had hydraulicapplied service brakes at all four wheels with dry caliper disc type brakes on the steering axle front brakes and enclosed wet disc type brakes on the drive axle rear brakes the service brakes were modulated by a foot pedal on the right side of the operators compartment right foot brake pedal the air portion of the service brake system was damaged in the accident andor recovery of the truck the relay valve for the front brake system had structural damage at a few of the air ports several fittings and an air line in the general vicinity of the relay valve were also damaged these items were replaced in order to conduct brake system tests the air over hydraulic brake converter for the front brakes did not produce hydraulic pressure when tested the brake converter was removed from the truck and partially disassembled for visual inspection the master cylinder the hydraulic portion of the brake converter piston was determined to be seizing within the bore near the end of its stroke and the return spring in the rotochamber could not overcome the friction of the piston against the cylinder wall this prevented the piston from returning to the released position the investigators determined by visual observations that the piston was seizing within the bore prior to the accident damage to the piston and bore prevented the piston from returning to the fully released position when the truck was operated the piston kept working its way to a full stroke position within the bore during cycling of the service brakes the condition of this brake converter would have caused it to eventually not produce any effective pressure to the front brakes once the piston neared the full stroke position within the cylinder bore the investigators determined that this defect did not contribute to the cause of the accident a noncontributory citation was issued for this violation the air over hydraulic brake converter for the rear brakes functioned properly when tested the hydraulic pressure for the rear brakes was approximately  pounds per square inch gauge psig with an air application pressure of approximately  psig this is approximately equal to the  to  output ratio of the rear brake converter stated in the service manual the parking brake system consisted of a springapplied hydraulic release system that used the same wet brake disc pack as the service brakes at each of the two rear wheels a finger operated flip switch mounted on the center console controlled the onoff function of the parking brake no problems were detected during testing of the parking brakes the switch cycled the release pressure for the parking brakes no significant pressure was lost in the system when the parking brakes were supplied with release pressure using a remote hydraulic pack while checking the wear for the wet brake disc pack the retarder system on this truck used the wet disc rear brakes air over hydraulic rear service brakes and was controlled by modulating a hand control lever on the right side of the steering column located underneath the steering wheel the hand lever modulated the brake pressure to the rear service brakes when tested this truck did not have the automatic retarder control arc option the truck also had a secondary brake system that was controlled by modulating a foot pedal on the left side of the operators compartment left foot brake pedal this brake system actuated the air over hydraulic front service brakes and the spring applied parking brakes on the rear wheels regardless of the position of the front brake switch this system would apply the front brakes when the secondary foot pedal was modulated to test this brake system an air line that appeared to be severed during the accident was repaired and the emergency towing feature of the secondary steering hydraulic circuit hydraulic pressure supplied by the electric driven hydraulic pump for the secondary steering was used to provide release pressure to the parking brakes the foot pedal modulated the air pressure to the front brakes and the parking brake hydraulic release pressure when tested the filters and screens for the hoist and brake hydraulic system were removed from the machine and inspected no significant debris was visually observed in any of the filters or screens that were removed none of the four drive lights appeared to have sustained damage during the accident all four drive lights illuminated when the dash panel switch was cycled to the on position steering system the truck had a hydraulic steering system primary steering system with an electric secondary steering system that provided hydraulic pressure to the steering controls in the event of an engine shutdown the hydraulic steering system was visually inspected and determined to be both mechanically and hydraulically intact the electric driven hydraulic pump for the secondary steering system provided backup steering pressure when tested no problems were identified with the primary or secondary steering systems that would have affected the ability of the operator to control the truck at the time of the accident transmission the truck had a seven speed automatic transmission with electronic shift control the transmission selector lever was reportedly found in the th gear position in this position the transmission would automatically shift up and downshift throughout the entire speed range st th gear position depending on rear wheel speed and engine rpm without requiring the operator to manually shift the selector lever the maximum truck speed setting was  mph diagnostic tests stored information regarding tattletale diagnostic codes equipment maintenance history and programmable operating parameters were viewed using caterpillars electronic technician software current or logged codes that were not damaged by the accident were checked the diagnostic testing did not reveal any conditions that would have affected the ability of the operator to control the truck at the time of the accident work practice experienced miners were usually assigned to provide comprehensive andor task training to new employees training and experience james e woosley sr had worked at this mine for one year and  weeks he had received his  hours of new miner training in accordance with  cfr part  however there were no records to indicate that he had received task training on the haul truck that the new miner was operating at the time of the accident jon bexley had worked at this mine eight days and had completed  classroom hours of the required  hours of new miner training when the accident occurred he had no previous mining experience and had no previous experience operating heavy equipment root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following causal factor was identified causal factor management policies procedures and controls were inadequate and failed to ensure that employees received training in the health and safety aspects and safe work procedures related to operating mobile equipment the new miner being trained did not maintain control of the equipment he was operating task training at this mine was inadequate because the new miner who was driving the haul truck had no previous experience operating mobile equipment the operators manual was not part of the task training there were no records indicating that the miner who was providing the task training had received any task training on the operation of this model haul truck corrective action procedures should be established to provide adequate training to employees before they operate mobile equipment classroom training that includes a through review of the operators manual should be provided prior to operating mobile equipment written safety rules and requirements should be made a handson part of task training monitor employees to ensure compliance with safe operating procedures at a location where production is not the primary objective conclusion the accident occurred because the task training procedures for the newly hired miner were inadequate to ensure he could safely operate the haul truck the trainee operator had no previous experience operating heavy equipment he had not completed his  hour new miner training before being assigned work duties the operators manual for the haul truck and other written procedures were available but were not used for

accordance with the national electrical safety code management failed to inspect and verify that the guy wire was installed properly to ensure that persons working or traveling in that area could safely perform their assigned tasks general information the adams mine a surface limestone operation owned and operated by specialty minerals inc was located in adams berkshire county massachusetts the principal operating official was paul r saueracker president the mine operated three hour shifts per day five days per week and employed  persons limestone was blasted from multiple benches and transported to the crushing plant by haul trucks where it is sized and processed into ground calcium carbonate limestone precipitated calcium carbonate and lime finish products were sold for use in the paper coatings building materials ceramic glass polymer and food industries adams trucking co inc adams trucking an independent company was located in north adams berkshire county massachusetts the principal operating official was alan dellaghelfa owner specialty minerals inc contracted with adams trucking to provide laborers to perform general cleanup and maintenance work at the mine these employees reported to the mine daily to receive their work assignments the last regular inspection at this operation was completed on january   description of the accident on the day of the accident jason m houran victim reported for work at  am his normal starting time houran and david kustra coworker began trimming weeds and brush around the mine with power trimmers equipped with metal brush cutting blades at approximately  am they began clearing brush around the substation  area they worked in opposite directions and planned to meet in the middle of the area the area contained a cement

mshas accident investigation team traveled to the mine made a physical inspection of the accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and employees the contractor management and employees and personnel from the massachusetts department of labors division of occupational safety appendix a discussion location of the accident the accident occurred at the area surrounding the pump house and substation  utility pole the weather was cloudy and warm with a high temperature of  degrees fahrenheit the weather on the day of the accident was not found to be a contributing factor description of mine power system massachusetts electric a national grid company supplied threephase  volt power to a metering pole from either of two selectable overhead supply lines the two different overhead supply lines provided redundancy in the event that one overhead supply line was disrupted both overhead supply lines originated at the utilityowned  kv substation located approximately one mile away from the mine the  volt power was supplied by three transformers at the utilityowned substation the secondary sides of two transformers were connected delta and the third transformer secondary was connected neutral grounded wye since a grounded neutral conductor was not distributed with the three phase conductors the ground fault electrical return path was through the earth the mine distributed power directly from the utilityowned metering pole using overhead power lines a substation was not installed to isolate the mine overhead power system from the utility overhead power system the mine installed approximately  feet of  aluminum conductor between the metering pole and the accident location at substation  substation  consisted of three individual  volt  kva transformers mounted on a utility pole the transformers were connected in a phase deltadelta configuration the primaries of the  transformers were supplied power through three  ampere fuses three  ampere isolation fuses were also installed approximately  feet upstream from substation  lightning arrestors  kv were provided at the top of the substation  utility pole and grounded to a  ohm poleground the secondary side of the polemounted transformers supplied  volt power to the pump house building various secondary loads were supplied from the pump house building including lighting circuits a horsepower water pump motor and a horsepower mine sump pump motor the overhead supply line was terminated at the substation  utility pole a single guy wire was installed to secure the pole and counterbalance the weight of the transmission lines guy installation a foot long insulator rated at  kv dry and  kv wet was anchored to the top of the utility pole  feet above ground level the bottom end of the insulator was attached to a foot long galvanized steel wire which stretched to an anchor imbedded in the ground this anchor was installed  feet from the base of the pole appendix b spiralwound preformed wire loops were constructed from five inch diameter galvanized steel wires twisted together to form a single inch diameter wire strand the guy wire tension caused the spiralwound preformed loops wrapped onto the ends of the wire to grip the guy wire installation of power service in december  specialty minerals inc contracted bemis line construction co inc to install the power service for the mine the service in part consisted of the substation  utility pole guy wire and three polemounted transformers in  the originally installed transformers were struck by lightning bemis line construction co inc was contracted to replace the damaged transformers with new transformers electrical details of the accident the spiralwound preformed loop attached to the anchor at ground level was severed by the metal blade on the weed trimmer once severed the tension and weight of the guy wire caused it to move  inches away from the anchor toward the pole the spiral wound preformed loop attached to the upper portion of the guy dropped  inches onto the energized transformer supply conductor this caused a phase to ground fault on the middle phase of the distribution line and energized the guy wire it rapidly developed into a phase to phase fault causing two  ampere fuses on substation  pole to open two  ampere isolation fuses approximately  feet away on the supply side also opened the guy wire remained energized until massachusetts electric arrived and interrupted power to the entire mine site power trimmer involved in the accident the gasolinepowered trimmer involved in the accident was a shindaiwa t that was equipped with an  ï¿½ inch diameter metal brush cutting blade the lower handle of the trimmer was comprised of a metal frame with a rubber midsection the left hand clamp on the rubber midsection was missing allowing the rubber section to slip from the metal frame according to the manufacturers operation manual the power trimmer was to be operated with a shoulder harness and cutting guard at the time of the accident these two safety items were not being used these defects were found to be violations however they were not found to contribute to the accident and were cited separately training and experience jason m houran had been employed by adams trucking co inc for  years and worked on this mine site for approximately  year and  months there was no evidence that the victim had received hour new miner training or sitespecific hazard awareness training these violations were not found to contribute to the accident and were cited separately root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following root causes were identified root cause standards and controls were inadequate management failed to inspect and verify that the guy wire was installed properly corrective actions establish a formal system that requires management to plan design review inspect and test all installation or repair projects root cause the provided guy wire on the power pole was not installed in accordance with the national electrical safety code the guy wire was not provided with two insulators installed to include the exposed section of the guy wire between them the slackened guy wire contacted the energized transformer supply conductor below the provided insulator thus energizing the wire corrective actions evaluate all electrical installations to ensure compliance with the required standards and codes inspect the work of independent contractors to ensure that installations and repairs to electrical systems are properly completed conclusion the accident occurred because the guy wire on the substation  utility pole was not installed in accordance with the national electrical safety code the guy wire was not provided with the correct number of insulators to prevent the guy wire from becoming energized when it contacted the energized supply conductor on the utility pole enforcement actions specialty minerals inc order no  was issued on july   under the provisions of section k of

street room  dallas texas  edward e lopez district manager overview on march   robert m taylor selfemployed electrician age  was fatally injured when he contacted an energized electrical circuit taylor was troubleshooting an electrical problem at the secondary plant the accident occurred because there were no safe operating procedures in place to ensure that the circuit breakers were deenergized locked out tagged and the volt circuit tested prior to performing any electrical work on individual circuits general information fairland quarry a crushed limestone operation owned and operated by capitol aggregates ltd was located near marble falls burnet county texas the principal operating official was bart ballard plant manager the mine operated one shift per day five days per week total employment was  persons limestone was drilled blasted and hauled by truck to the primary crusher located in the pit crushed rock was conveyed to the secondary plant where it was crushed screened and washed finished products were sold to customers for construction aggregate robert m taylor was a selfemployed electrician who had performed electrical work at this mine on previous occasions the last regular inspection at this operation was completed on november   description of the accident on the day of the accident employees of fairland quarry began work at  am and started the secondary plant but experienced problems starting the overland conveyor bart ballard plant manager called robert taylor electrician at  am to discuss the problem taylor suggested replacing the control transformer for the conveyor a replacement transformer was located at a nearby mine lance basancon foreman removed the old transformer and replaced it with the assistance of jerome martin primary plant operator because the conveyor still would not start after the secondary plant was restarted taylor was called again at  am taylor arrived at the mine at  am and checked the installation of the new control transformer and found that the ground was not properly installed he corrected the installation of the ground and checked it with a meter the overland conveyor was turned on but appeared to be singlephasing and would not start taylor went under the secondary plant control building and removed the covers from two junction boxes through which power came to the secondary plant main circuit and spokane  circuit taylor concluded that one of the phase conductors to the main circuit was damaged because he measured a voltage drop when the overland conveyor was turned on taylor asked basancon to assist him in identifying the damaged conductor at the main circuit breaker taylor did not have the necessary equipment to test the circuit without energizing it basancon turned off the main circuit breaker and the spokane  circuit breaker and disconnected one phase conductor on the output side of the main breaker he then turned on both circuit breakers while taylor checked at the main junction box to determine that the damaged conductor was still connected at the main breaker basancon turned both circuit breakers off reconnected the conductor and disconnected a second phase conductor from the output side of the main breaker taylor checked and determined that they had found the damaged conductor basancon then turned both breakers off and directed mine employees to dig a hole next to the main circuit breaker to expose the conduit that contained the damaged conductor he intended to pull the damaged conductor from the conduit and replace it with a new conductor ballard came to the main breaker about that time and instructed martin to make sure the power was off martin checked and found both breakers were off soon thereafter ballard and taylor decided to install a new conductor in an existing cable tray rather than pull it through the buried conduit mine employees were then directed to measure the distance from the main circuit breaker to the junction box at  pm taylor returned to the open junction boxes under the control building he apparently contacted an energized electrical circuit inside the spokane  junction box msha investigators could not establish when or by whom the power was turned on ballard returned from the scale house at  pm and found taylor lying on the ground near the open junction boxes under the secondary plant control building ballard approached taylor determined that he had been injured and radioed the scale house for help ballard instructed martin to check the secondary plant power martin stated he found the main circuit breaker off but did not check the spokane  circuit breaker ballard and basancon removed taylor from beneath the secondary plant control building mine employees performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on taylor until emergency medical personnel arrived taylor was taken to a local hospital and was pronounced dead death was attributed to electrocution terry worley mine safety and health inspector arrived at the mine about  pm he checked both the main junction box and the spokane  junction box and determined that both were deenergized prior to his arrival investigators were unable to determine who had turned off the spokane  circuit breaker investigation of the accident msha was notified of the accident at  pm march   by a telephone call from benjamin don patrick corporate safety director to ralph rodriguez supervisory mine safety and health inspector an investigation was started that day an order was issued pursuant to section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners mshas accident investigation team traveled to the mine made a physical inspection of the accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management employees and county officials discussion location of the accident the accident occurred at the spokane  circuit junction box beneath the secondary plant control building although weather conditions were sunny and warm the ground in this area was damp from recent rainfall secondary plant the secondary plant consisted of several crushers screens conveyor belts and screw conveyors there were a total of  pieces of equipment in  different processing circuits the spokane  crusher was installed after the secondary plant was constructed and had operated for several years the plant control building was built on vertical steel ibeams to place it about six feet above the ground the area beneath the control building was bare ground and was open to the weather electrical service electrical service to the secondary plant was purchased from a local electric cooperative at  volts to a utilityowned transformer that reduced the voltage to  volts two electrical feeder circuits for the secondary plant were connected to the transformer and were referred to as the main circuit and the spokane  circuit circuit breakers the main circuit of the secondary plant was protected by a amp circuit breaker located in a box about  feet from the control building this breaker protected all of the secondary plant equipment with the exception of the spokane  crusher and was labeled main the spokane  circuit was protected by an amp circuit breaker located on a service pole about  feet from the main breaker this breaker protected only the spokane  crusher and was labeled spokane  neither circuit breaker location was visible from the area beneath the secondary plant control building junction boxes electrical conductors from the two circuit breakers ran in buried conduit to two junction boxes beneath one corner of the secondary plant control building each junction box was upright with the lower edge about  inches above ground level and the upper edge about  inches above ground level the boxes were about two feet apart but were turned ninety degrees to each other the front cover of each box was lying on the ground at the time of the accident training taylor was a master electrician with more than  years of experience he had received site specific hazardous awareness training as required in  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following causal factors were identified causal factor management policies standards and controls were inadequate the mine operator did not provide taylor with training on the electrical configuration of the secondary plant supervisors were unaware of which circuit was controlled by the spokane  breaker corrective action management should provide indepth training regarding the electrical configuration of the secondary plant to ensure that an electrician can safely troubleshoot and make necessary electrical repairs causal factor the spokane  circuit breaker was not deenergized locked out tagged and tested before repairs were attempted no procedures were in place to ensure that the task could be safely completed corrective action management should establish procedures to ensure power circuits are deenergized locked out tagged and tested prior to performing work management should review the lockout procedures and conduct a risk assessment before electrical work is performed conclusion the accident occurred because there were no safe operating procedures in place to ensure that the circuit breakers were deenergized locked out tagged and the volt circuit tested prior to performing any electrical work on individual circuits enforcement actions order no  was issued on march   under the provisions of section k of the mine act a fatal accident occurred at this operation on march   while an electrician was conducting electrical tests at the secondary plant this order is issued to assure the safety of all persons at this operation and prohibits all activity under the lower end of the secondary plant including the control building and the incoming circuit breakers until msha has determined that it is safe to resume normal operations the mine operator shall obtain prior approval from an authorized representative for all actions to recover andor restore operations to the affected area this citation was terminated on april   after the conditions that contributed to the accident no longer existed citation no  was issued on april   under provisions of section d of the mine act for a violation of  cfr  a fatal accident occurred at this operation on march   when a circuit breaker was not locked out nor were other means taken to prevent the electrical circuit from being energized without the knowledge of the individuals working on it the operator engaged in aggravated conduct constituting more than ordinary negligence in that management was aware that the circuit breaker was not locked out while an electrician worked on the electrical circuit this violation was an unwarrantable failure to comply with a mandatory standard this citation was terminated on

work platform of a mobile radial stacker conveyor when the main truss failed the failure of the truss caused the conveyor to buckle allowing the head pulley section to fall to the ground the conveyor was being prepared for movement to another location when the accident occurred the accident occurred because management modified the manufacturers field conveyor design and compromised the structural integrity of the conveyor management did not consult the manufacturer of the conveyor or follow established engineering principles when making the modifications general information jammer lake pitvirginia a surface sand and gravel mining operation owned and operated by seppi brothers concrete products corporation was located in virginia st louis county minnesota the principal operating official was matt seppi president the mine was normally operated one hour shift per day five days a week total employment was two persons sand and gravel was mined from a single bench open pit by frontendloader and placed into a portable crusher material was then screened washed and stockpiled to size finished products were sold for use in the construction industry mining had ceased at this location on november   and the company was in the process of dismantling sections of the plant for relocation the last regular inspection of this mine was completed on october   description of accident on the day of the accident christopher m luecken victim reported for work at  am his normal starting time he usually worked at the companys portable crusher mine but was assigned to assist with dismantling equipment at the jammer lake pit virginia that day upon arrival he met with donald luecken foreman and the victims brother and patrick christensen equipment operator to discuss work assignments required to relocate the ï¿½ inch rock conveyor they first moved the ï¿½inch rock conveyor radially south  feet to level ground with a frontend loader a torch was used to remove a section of the hopper chute located above the tail pulley end of the conveyor a crane was used to individually lift the north and south wheel assemblies of the conveyor off the ground to enable the conveyor wheels to be repositioned for towing christopher luecken and christensen then installed a chain to the conveyors wheel assembly so the frontend loader could pull the conveyor from the wash plant about  am donald luecken used a torch to cut a steel pin that attached the ï¿½inch rock conveyor tail pulley to the frame of the wash plant prior to completely cutting the pin christensen interrupted him to discuss concerns that the chain was too short and that if the conveyor tipped the head pulley of the conveyor could strike the frontendloaders cab donald luecken then asked christensen and christopher luecken to look for additional chains a short time later donald luecken walked to his pickup truck to check for messages on his cell phone about  am christensen and christopher luecken were working under the conveyors head pulley work platform installing the extra length of chain when the truss frame failed allowing the truss to buckle and the head pulley platform to fall they attempted to escape from the falling conveyor but the victim was struck by the head pulley platform donald luecken heard the conveyor truss fail and returned to find his brother pinned under the head pulley platform the frontendloader was used to lift the head pulley work platform off the victim and emergency medical assistance was summoned emergency medical personnel arrived at the scene but could not resuscitate the victim at  am he was pronounced dead at the scene by the st louis county medical examiners deputy coroner death was attributed to multiple traumatic injuries investigation of accident msha was notified on november   at  am by a telephone call from the st louis county sheriffs department to mshas hotline gerald holeman assistant district manager was called and an investigation began the same day an order was issued pursuant to section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners mshas accident investigation team conducted a physical inspection of the accident site interviewed employees and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and employees discussion location of the accident the accident occurred at the wash plant ï¿½inch rock conveyor the immediate ground had been cleared of processed materials and leveled in preparation to relocate the conveyor the ground was frozen and firmly packed with rock material conveyor the pioneer knockdown kd inch super service ss conveyor was originally constructed as a stationary fixed conveyor system structural support for the original conveyor design was provided by two fixed intermediate vertical bents the conveyor sections consisted of two parallel weldedtruss frames with diagonal and lateral cross bracing each footlong truss section was bolted to the adjacent truss section using a lateral frame the conveyor drive was located at the head end of the conveyor a steel framed platform with a wooden deck provided access to the conveyor drive assembly in april  the mine operator modified the stationary fixed conveyor to a radial stacking conveyor structural steel from the original vertical bents was removed and reused for the construction of a new structural support framework and cradle truck assembly the modified conveyor was constructed with a footlong cantilevered truss section at the head end of the conveyor corbel connections along the bottom chords were modified to attach the structural support framework the tail section of the conveyor was modified to provide a pivoting base plate with a bolted rotating pivot point the cradle truck assembly was fabricated using steel beams structural tubing and angles the truck assembly was outfitted with two manual swivel pivoting steel wheels and pneumatic tires the pivoting wheel assembly provided the capability to move the conveyor in either a parallel or perpendicular direction the head pulley section of the modified radial stacking conveyor weighed approximately  pounds and the tail pulley section about  pounds equipment conveyor failure scenario the modified radial stacker conveyor failed as follows see appendix b prior to the accident the wheels of the cradle truck assembly were oriented perpendicular to the conveyor in this position sufficient rolling resistance was provided to prevent movementrotation in the direction away from or toward the pivot point in preparation for moving the conveyor the pivoting wheel assembly was rotated parallel to the conveyor this wheel orientation provided little resistance against movement in a direction away from or toward the pivot point the weight associated with the head pulley  pounds and the cantilevered portion of the conveyor truss sections located at the head section created a downward force on the front support arm of the cradle truck assembly the head section and cantilevered portion of the conveyor deflected downward due to the configuration of the conveyor structure and loads involved this movement caused the front support for the vshaped support framework to push downward the wheels allowed the support framework to rotate so the rear support pushed upward the load from the cantilevered portion of the conveyor including the head pulley was transmitted into the bottom chord of the conveyor truss the length and location of the corbel connection was not capable of distributing the load sufficiently over the bottom chord of the truss this caused the bottom chord to buckle as the bottom chord buckled the top chord became overloaded in tension as the head end of the conveyor dropped further this ultimately caused the high strength bolts in the top chord of the truss to fail once the bottom and top chords of the conveyor truss failed the head end of the conveyor could no longer be supported and it dropped to the ground weather conditions weather conditions were reported to be cold and clear with a slight wind weather was not considered a factor in the accident training and experience christopher m luecken had  years and  month of mining experience all at seppi brothers concrete products corporation and had received training in accordance with  cfr part  two to three times a year he dismantled and moved mining equipment including conveyors donald e luecken had  years and  months of mining experience all at seppi brothers

christensen had  years and  months of mining experience all at seppi brothers concrete products corporation he had received training in accordance with  cfr part  two to three times a year he dismantled and assembled portable crushing equipment including conveyors medical analysis and findings a sample of the victims urine was analyzed for alcohol and drugs the drug screen indicated prior use of marijuana impairment could not be assessed without observations of the victims behavior prior to his death root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following root causes were identified root cause management standards and controls were inadequate the mine operator failed to consult with the manufacturer of the conveyor or follow established engineering principles when making modifications the modifications completed by the mine operator compromised the structural integrity of the conveyor corrective action management should implement a policy ensuring that modifications to equipment are made by following established engineering principles so hazards to persons are not created conclusion the accident occurred because management failed to recognize that hazards to persons were created when they made modifications to the conveyor management did not consult the manufacturer of the conveyor or follow established engineering principles when making the modifications enforcement actions order no  was issued on october   under the provisions of section k of the mine act a fatal accident occurred at this operation on november   when a miner was struck by the upper section of the ï¿½inch stacker belt when it collapsed this order was issued to assure the safety of all persons at this operation it prohibits all activities around the wash plant until msha has determined it is safe to resume activity in the area the mine operator shall obtain prior approval from an authorized representative for all actions to recover and restore operations in the affected area the order was terminated on november   conditions that contributed to the accident no longer exist citation no  was issued on december   under the provisions of section a of the mine act for violation of  cfr  a fatal accident occurred at this mine on november   when a mobile radial stacker conveyors main truss failed allowing the head pulley end of the conveyor to fall to the ground striking a miner who was working below the mine operator modified this conveyor in april  from its originally manufactured fixed conveyor design to a radial stacker conveyor this modification resulted in using the equipment beyond the design capacity intended by the manufacturer and created a hazard to persons the citation was terminated on january   the mine operator removed the mobile radial

leadman age  was fatally injured when he was crushed between a set of ventilation air lock doors as they closed mathewson was working on the power circuit for the doors control switch located approximately  feet from the doors the accident occurred because safe work procedures had not been established and followed before work was performed on the control switch to the air lock doors the power to the circuit was not deenergized locked out or other measures taken to prevent the power circuit from being energized general information stillwater mine an underground platinum operation owned and operated by stillwater mining corporation was located near nye stillwater county montana the principal operating official was frank mcallister chief executive the mine normally operated two hour shifts a day seven days a week total employment was  persons ore was extracted using the rampandfill mining method sublevel stoping was also done along with cutandfill stoping mine access drifts were driven at different elevations approximately  percent of the ore was hoisted to the surface mill through a foot vertical shaft ore was hauled to the surface by trucks and a rail system that extended about  miles a milling facility was located at the mine site a smelter and the base metals refinery were located at a companyowned facility in columbus montana the last regular inspection of this operation was completed on february   an inspection was ongoing at the time of the accident description of the accident on the day of the accident cody mathewson victim reported for work at  pm his scheduled starting time at approximately  pm mathewson and jerald harris electrician  drove a utility truck to the  west  dump point air lock doors to complete repairs to the doors control switch mathewson began repairs to the control switch the previous night when they arrived at the air lock doors mathewson positioned the bed of the truck under the control switch to use it as a work platform mathewson asked harris to go to the electrical panel box located at the south end of the drift to lock out and tag out the power source to the control switch for the air doors mathewson then stood on the bed of the truck and removed the screws and cover plate on the control switch junction box to access the wiring when harris arrived at the panel box he turned the breaker marked air doors to the off position he was unable to lock the panel box door because his lock would not fit the hasp on the door he walked back to the utility truck to ask mathewson how to lock out and tag out the power source harris could not see mathewson or any light from his cap lamp he looked inside the utility truck cab and walked to the front of the truck harris looked toward the air doors and noticed the reflective strip on mathewsons right pant leg protruding from the door mine emergency personnel were contacted and arrived at the scene a short time later the county coroner was called and pronounced mathewson dead at the scene death was attributed to crushing trauma investigation of the accident msha was notified of the accident at  pm mst on april   by a telephone call from steve wood safety director to irvin t hooker district manager an investigation was started the same day an order was issued under the provision of section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners msha accident investigators traveled to the mine made a physical inspection of the accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management miners representatives and employees discussion location of the accident the accident occurred at the  west  dump point ventilation air lock doors environment the location where the accident occurred had approximately four to six inches of standing water the approximate temperature was  degrees fahrenheit and the humidity was approximately  percent the miners cap lights and the truck headlights were the only sources of illumination in the area air lock system the air lock system at the accident site consisted of two sets of airactuated metal doors operated by electrical controls the general direction of the doors within the drift was identified as the north set and the south set the victim was found pinned in the south set of doors a sketch of the accident scene is shown in figure no  both sets of doors operated independently of each other and had two pulltype control switches suspended in the drift for each set of doors one on each side of the respective set of doors to open andor close that specific set of doors the north set of doors were open at the time of the accident figure no  stillwater doors the mine had two types of air lock system designs an american style and a stillwater style the air lock system design involved in the accident was the stillwater type doors designed and installed by stillwater mining company personnel each of the two doors comprising each set was approximately  feet wide and  feet high and was similar in size and design each set had a  inch wide by  inch high opening with a sliding door in the bottom panel of a door to allow a person to crawl through air pressure for the system was provided by the compressed air supply for the mine the control system for the mines compressed air system monitored the air pressure and recorded the history of the pressure in the system technical data at the time of the accident indicated that there was no disruption of the compressed air supply for the mine a sketch of the control system for the pneumatic actuated cylinders is shown in figure no  electrically operated solenoids actuated a way position valve for a door open and a door close position constant pressure was provided to the respective side of the pneumatic cylinders even when the doors completed the opened or closed cycle the cylinders applied a force to the doors at all times during normal operation figure no  the pneumatic control system was functionally tested and the control valve was disassembled for visual inspection no internal leaks were observed during testing that could cause unintended actuation of the door cylinders no problems were identified with the pneumatic control system or the disassembled control valve that may have contributed to the accident product information indicated that the seveninch bore cylinder was capable of producing approximately  pounds of pulling force at  pounds per square inch using this information it was estimated that the door edge that pinned mathewson would have exerted a crushing force of approximately  pounds on him the cycle time to open andor close the doors time lapse between when the pull switch was actuated and when the doors completed movement was measured to be approximately  to  seconds regardless of whether the north set of doors were open or closed andor if the supplemental ventilation fan was on or off the west door of the south set of air lock doors accident doors always completed its closing or opening cycle after the east door electrical power to both sets of doors was supplied from a single  amp  volt circuit breaker the breaker was located in a residentialtype panel box approximately  feet from the doors the panel box was situated at the main entrance to the drift a red strobe indicator light was located at each switch location the light flashed when the switch was pulled to open the doors and would remain on until the switch was pulled to close the doors the light bulb was missing at the switch being repaired training and experience mathewson had  years mining experience he had received training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following causal factor was identified causal factor management policies and controls were inadequate because lock outtag out procedures could not be used for all electrical work performed an electrician had attempted to lock out the circuit breaker for the control switch but the lock issued by management to the electrical crews was not compatible with the electrical panel box obvious problems with lock out tag out of the smaller residential type panel boxes were apparent because the locks that were issued would not sufficiently fit these smaller boxes work practices and policies stated that the doors were to be blocked against motion and all power sources were to be locked out and tagged out corrective action lock outtag out procedures should be established that apply to all the various electrical equipment at the mine site any locks issues to electricians should be compatible with the panel boxes being locked out these procedures should also require that any equipment being worked on be blocked against hazardous motion before work is performed management and mine employees should conduct a risk assessment analysis before any electrical work is started conclusion the accident occurred because safe work procedures had not been followed before work was done on the control switch to the air lock doors the power to the circuit was not deenergized locked out or other measures taken to prevent the power circuit from being energized enforcement actions order no  was issued on april   under the provisions of section k of the mine act a fatal accident occurred on april   when an electrician was attempting to repair the air lock doors at the  west  dump point this order is issued to ensure the safety of all persons

injured on july   when a fall of ground occurred entrapping him in the cab of a service truck ivins had completed repairs to a roof bolter and was waiting for another truck to move when three separate falls of ground occurred the first fall covered the bed of his truck the second covered the cab and the third covered the remainder of the truck the accident occurred because management failed to ensure that adverse ground conditions identified during the mining cycle were adequately supported management provided a ground control plan listing ground support systems that would enhance control of adverse ground however these systems were not fully implemented supplemental support materials identified in the ground control plan were not readily available general information the genesis inc troy mine an underground copper mine located near troy lincoln county montana was owned and operated by genesis inc the principal operating official was douglas p miller general manager the mine normally operated two hour shifts per day seven days a week total employment was  persons the rock was drilled blasted and moved by frontend loaders and trucks to an underground crushing facility and then to feed bins the material was transported to the surface by conveyor where it was milled and processed the finished products were shipped and sold to commercial industries the last regular inspection at this operation was completed on may   description of accident on july   michael e ivins victim reported to work at  am at the surface shop darryl moss maintenance team leader assigned ivins several repair projects ivins was notified between  and  am that a roof bolter had a broken hydraulic hose and needed repaired he arrived in the middle east me  heading parked the service truck and walked to the roof bolter in crosscut me w ivins removed the defective hose and went to an underground shop where he made a replacement hose when he returned to the me section ivins parked the service truck inby crosscut me v in the me  drift and repaired the roof bolter cole anderson shift boss entered the me  heading about  am and parked his truck below crosscut me v he walked to ivins service truck and spoke to ivins who was sitting in the truck ivins told anderson the bolter was repaired anderson walked to the face areas and spoke with josh peterson roof bolter operator and allen layer roof bolter trainee both miners reviewed the work they intended to do since the roof bolter was now operable peterson and layer reported loose ground on the east rib line of the pillar between me v and me w both miners stated they were going to work away from the loose corner until it could be supported about  am anderson examined the area and returned to his truck he noted that ivins had backed his service truck into the me v crosscut ivins was waiting for anderson to move his truck so he could leave the area ivins signaled to anderson indicating material had fallen out of the roof where they had been standing when they had spoken earlier at that time more rock fell so anderson yelled to layer and peterson to get out of their work area peterson and layer ran south in drift me  from crosscut w towards crosscut v both miners stated ivins was parked in crosscut v as they ran past him anderson reached his pickup as additional falling material struck the back of ivins truck causing one of the rear tires to blow out anderson entered the drivers door of his truck and layer went in the passenger door when another fall of material occurred covering the cab area of ivins truck additional material fell striking the drivers side of andersons truck pushing it hard to the right toward crosscut me u peterson was struck by andersons truck at the right front fender area and was thrown across the me entry into crosscut u the fallen material covered ivins truck cab leaving only the grille visible anderson and layer exited the pickup truck ran south in entry me and met peterson at crosscut v in the me  heading as several other miners responded to the scene arc flashes and smoke were observed coming from under the hood of ivins truck and a fire ensued at  am jeff franke safety engineer was notified that a fall of ground had occurred trapping ivins in his truck franke notified emergency personnel and the mine was evacuated due to the fire and smoke mine rescue teams were assembled a plan was submitted to the mine safety and health administration msha and approved recovery efforts began and at  pm ivins truck was recovered and pulled into crosscut v in me heading at  pm the coroner examined the accident scene and pronounced the victim dead the cause of death was attributed to blunt force trauma investigation of the accident msha was notified of the accident at  am on july   by a telephone call from jeff franke safety engineer to curtis r petty supervisory mine safety and health inspector an investigation was started the same day an order was issued under the provisions of section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners mshas accident investigation team traveled to the mine conducted a physical inspection of the accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management employees and the county sheriffs office discussion location of the accident the area where the accident occurred was a small roomandpillar section located east of the  fault zone which bounded the main ore body the area was designated as the middle east or me section drifts were aligned in parallel to the strike of the  fault in a northwest orientation with crosscuts on approximately foot centers offset between adjacent drifts each crosscut was designated in an ascending alphabetical order going north with the drifts identified numerically in descending order away from the  fault zone the west pillar rib line of each drift started the next sequential numbering the fall of ground occurred in the me  v crosscut at the intersection with the me  drift figure  geology the mine was developed in three stacked ore bodies each located in the informally named lower middle and upper units of the midproterozoicaged upper revett quartzite the ore bodies were constrained by bedding layers and faults a dip of  to  degrees to the southwest was reported mining practices in accident area the ore body was mined utilizing roomandpillar extraction methods pillars were mostly rectangular in shape and the length and width varied between  and  feet since the pillars were ore secondary mining of the pillars was common after the initial drift had advanced to a predetermined depth entry widths were initially driven about  feet wide secondary mining increased the entry width by as much as  feet pillar sloughing increased the entry width by  to  feet more extraction height measured at several locations averaged  feet brows and cavities were noted throughout the me north ore zone thicker parts of the middle ore body were mined up to  feet high the sections orientation was noted to run parallel with the  fault with perpendicular joints running from the major units in the section the face blasting pattern was modified to accommodate the blocky bedded ore making for softer shots to control roof and rib degradation roof bolter the roof bolter used to install bolts in the accident area was manufactured by atlascopcoboltec mc the carrier was a dieselelectric unit on an articulating frame the operation station was climatecontrolled with a telescoping falling object protective structure and noise reduction added the drill featured an interactive control system with automatic functions for auto collaring antijamming drill control and diagnostic and fault systems the bolter unit worked as a single feed multifunction drill a variety of bolting units were available from the manufacturer which allowed the installation of different bolt types and sizes management optioned for swellex bolts to control the ground the roof bolter drilled inserted and pressurized the swellex bolt to bore size maximum bolt length was eight feet for this system the drill boom was designed to rotate  degrees with a forward tilt that could install bolts from one rib across the roof to the other rib occasionally rib bolts were installed to support utility lines but rib bolts were not installed in the me section two sandviktamrock roof bolters one which could install  inch resin grouted bolts of varying lengths among other types of bolts were available at the mine these units were not in the me section during the accident and reportedly had not been used during the section development since the breach of the  fault when the mine was first developed fullygrouted rebar was installed to control the ground when the mine reopened in  the mine operator chose to use swellex bolts the bolting pattern consisted of foot long swellex bolts installed on a foot by foot staggered pattern fall of ground the initial fall of ground occurred at a fault zone in the me  at the v crosscut figure  the fault zone had been encountered in the me  drift between the me t and me u crosscuts the me  drift was advanced with the fault zone exposed in the back for a distance of approximately  feet the crosscut was advanced westward to the  fault contact zone as were all the previous me  crosscuts management indicated that ground conditions had been very difficult after encountering the fault zone ground water was observed flowing from several joints in the section and a brown stain was noted on fallen material difficulties were encountered supporting the back due to stability problems with jointing and spans to stabilize the fractured back between the swellex bolts in this fault zone welded wire mesh was bolted to the back and shotcrete was applied the shotcrete constituted a thin surface coating that was ineffective for ground stabilization management indicated that the fault zone was so problematic that the next pillar bounded by the me u and me v crosscuts had not been reduced by secondary mining in an attempt to leave rock to support the fault zone mine maps provided by management indicated that the fault zone continued along the me  drift beyond this pillar but the next pillar was reduced in size by secondary mining to extract ore the utility truck the victim was operating was parked directly underneath the fault zone where it projected across the mouth of the me v crosscut in the me  drift despite recognizing the fault as difficult to control additional ground support had not been utilized and the me  drift had not been barricaded prior to the accident records noted that on several occasions the roof and face either had voids mud slips or fall of materials drift width varied between  to  feet with a height of  to  feet wire mesh and foot swellex bolts had been installed over the brows in the crosscut but rib bolts had not been installed the continuing deteriorating ground conditions indicated that the current support was inadequate and that different support or supplemental support materials was needed since the bolter in this section was limited to installing foot swellex bolts another machine would have been needed to install different supports after the ground fall rock fragments ranged in size and were defined by smoother more regular surfaces indicative of naturally occurring geologic structures the host quartzite was cut by abundant parallel joint planes spaced  inches apart defining a texture of stacked cubes in the back and ribs throughout the me section the material that originally fell was estimated at  tons the initial material removed during recovery placed the break above the anchor point of the foot swellex bolts the day after the fall it had extended south approximately  feet north  feet and across the span of the me  entry to the east pillar line the apex of the fall could not be accurately calculated from the toe of the fall because the distance exceeded the maximum range of the laser range finder the fall was estimated to be more than  feet above the original roof and the fallen material after the recovery was estimated at  tons ground support plan the ground support for typical ground conditions in the mine consisted of the installation of foot swellex roof bolts with a inch by inch bearing plate on a foot by foot staggered pattern an additional roof bolt was installed along the open end of the staggered row to keep roof bolts adjacent to the rib line roof bolts were installed within  feet of the working face when adverse conditions were encountered swellex bolts were installed on a foot by foot staggered pattern in inch holes with inch by inch dome embossed grade  plates where more difficult ground conditions were encountered  gauge welded wire inch mesh was installed overlapping tight to the roof with the swellex bolts in some areas shotcrete was applied in a thin layer over the ribs and roof bolts plates and mesh for additional support the ground support plan included grouted dywidag bolts steel mats shotcrete and steel arch sets when checked no steel arch support sets were on site training and experience michael e ivins had two years  months mining experience all at this mine he had received training in accordance with  cfr part  cole anderson had three years mining experience he had received training in accordance with  cfr part  allen layer had  months mining experience all at this mine he had received training in accordance with  cfr part  josh peterson had one year  months mining experience all at this mine he had received training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following causal factors were identified causal factor management policies procedures and controls were inadequate and did not ensure that persons were protected from fall of ground hazards where they worked or traveled management failed to follow the ground support plan they had established and did not require additional ground support to be installed in the location where the fault existed corrective action management should design and implement a ground support system for the entire mine that controls the ground where persons work or travel machinery and materials to provide additional ground support should be readily available underground when ground conditions require their use miners should be trained to install additional support when necessary in adverse conditions causal factor management failed to address adverse ground conditions identified and reported during work place examinations persons conducting the examinations failed to require additional roof support materials be installed to control the ground where the fault was visible corrective action management should establish procedures to ensure ground examinations are conducted and adverse ground conditions are taken down or adequately supported persons conducting the examinations should be trained to recognize and eliminate hazardous ground conditions conclusion the accident occurred because management failed to ensure that adverse ground conditions identified during the mining cycle were adequately supported management provided a ground control plan listing ground support systems that would enhance control of adverse ground however these systems were not fully implemented supplemental support materials identified in the ground control plan were not readily available enforcement actions order no  was issued on july   under the provisions of section k of the mine act a serious accident occurred at this operation on july

building about eight feet from the work platform the aerial platform had been positioned between the raw mill building and a storage building the area was level and the floor between the buildings was concrete the machine was stationed parallel to the side of the raw mill building when the accident occurred due to the configuration of the support structure of the raw mill building the basket had to be maneuvered through the structure by moving it in eight feet and up ten feet to the platform level the opening in the structure was ten feet high and the width ranged from sixteen feet at the bottom to eight feet at the top the weather conditions at the time of the accident were clear with no wind and a temperature of  degrees fahrenheit aerial platform the self propelled  jlg aerial platform model  sjd weighed  pounds and was equipped with a deutz four cylinder  hp diesel engine the controls of the platform contained a switch that allowed the operator to select a weight capacity between

overrode the basket controls both the ground controls and the basket controls could be used to start the machine the basket control panel also controlled the movements of the aerial platform the ground control station was located at the right rear of the main body of the machine and also controlled the movement of the basket the ground controls were used to lower the basket in case of an emergency or if the operator inside the basket was unable to lower the basket the ground control station did not have controls for driving the machine the operator stood on the ground beside the machine when using the ground controls the speed control dial controlled the maximum speed of most of the boom movements and was found set in the position for the maximum speed test showed the speed control reduced the speed of the boom and basket movements but did not control the speed of the basket rotation a joystick provided control for driving the aerial platform either forward or backward when tested the joystick spring returned to neutral when released and was working properly the locking ring which prevented accidental movement of the joystick was operating properly tests showed the drive speedtorque select switch which varies the amount of torque and speed available to for use for driving the aerial platform was operating properly the drive speedtorque select switch was set for the slowest available drive speed when the accident occurred the amount of available drive speed used was proportional to the amount of joystick movement the steering control on top of the drive joystick inside the basket was operating properly the steer select switch was operating properly this switch was found in the four wheel steer position allowing for the tightest radius by turning both the front and rear wheels in the same direction when tested the axle extendretract switch operated properly at the time of the accident the axles of the machine were extended for better stability the foot switch was required to be activated before the controls of the platform could be operated it was working properly a test of the basketground select switch indicated it was working properly when the switch was in the center position the controls at both control stations were disabled the engine shut off when this switch was used to switch the control of the machine from one control station to the other the operator was required to restart the engine before using the machine the machine shut down as designed the poweremergency stop button at each control station worked properly this control button was required to be pulled out before the machine could be started and operated when the switch was pushed in it caused the engine to stop and the controls to be disabled the startauxiliary power switch at both of the control stations would start the engine the boom and platform function could be operated using the auxiliary pump tests of the joystick on the basket used to control the main boom lift and swing functions showed the joystick worked properly with one exception the locking ring which prevented accidental movement for this joystick was not functional the joystick could be moved without lifting the lock ring tests of the boom controls indicated that checking the system slowed the boom movement speeds as the basket neared the edge of the working range the automatic slow down system was checked at several different locations within the working range and was operating properly after the machine was removed from the area where the accident occurred the boom was placed at the same angle and extended to the same height as it was when the accident occurred operation of the boom controls showed the boom movements were operating at a speed that indicated the boom was not within the part of the working range that caused automatic reduction in the boom movement speed the boom was not operating in the portion of the working range which caused automatic speed reduction this situation made the use of the speed control dial to reduce the maximum boom movement speed an important factor when the basket was maneuvered in the confined space of the accident location the control arc system which kept the boom extended to the same percentage of the maximum allowable extension when only the boom lift control was used to raise and lower the basket was checked and found to be working properly the control arc boom system could cause the boom to telescope into an overhead obstruction if an operator not properly trained pushed the boom lift control in the wrong direction and maneuvered the basket under the overhead obstruction the control arc boom system could also cause the boom to telescope outward into overhead obstructions if the boom liftswing control was accidentally pushed forward the investigation revealed the lock ring for preventing accidental movement of the boom lift and swing joystick control was not working this control could be activated without releasing the lock ring safety device tests indicated that the light and alarm that warned the operator that the booms lift and telescope functions had been disabled by the automatic control system were operative usually the alarm could not be heard above the noise of the plant although the scaffolding side boards being hauled at the time of the accident did not overload the basket they reduced the space and maneuverability of the operator in this position the victim was required to stand close to the control panel this increased the likelihood that the victim accidentally activated the main boom liftswing because the lock ring was broken training pierce had worked for brand for seven days as a laborer all at holcim he had not received training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following causal factors were identified causal factor a risk assessment to determine possible hazards and to establish safe work procedures was not conducted prior to performing the task of removing the scaffolding from the raw mill building corrective action procedures should be established that required a risk assessment be conducted to identify and correct potential hazards and to establish procedures to safely remove the scaffolding from the elevated location causal factor management policies standards and controls were inadequate neither the victim nor his foreman was trained in the health and safety aspects and safe procedures regarding the operating controls of the machine the speed control dial which controlled the maximum speed of most of the boom movements of the aerial platform was found set for the maximum possible speed corrective action management should develop and establish procedures to ensure that equipment operators are task trained to safely operate mobile equipment equipment operators should consult the operators manual for proper procedures prior to performing tasks management should monitor employees to ensure that training is adequate causal factor procedures were not in place to ensure that the victims movement was not restricted by material placed in the basket of the aerial platform corrective action procedures should be established that prohibit equipment operators from operating aerial platforms from the basket when clearance or freedom of movement within the basket is restricted causal factors management policies standards and controls were inadequate procedures for performing a preoperational inspection of the machine did not identify that the safety locking ring on the lateral and vertical movement control lever was inoperative the aerial platform was not removed from service and the defect was not repaired corrective action procedures should be established to ensure that preoperational inspections of mobile equipment are thoroughly conducted the procedures should address the immediate correction of any safety defects including criteria for removing mobile equipment from service conclusion the accident occurred because pierce was not trained to safely operate the aerial platform and had no previous work experience operating it the foreman who instructed the victim prior to the accident had not been trained on the safe operation of the machine the safety locking ring on the joystick control for the

first street room  duluth mn  steven m richetta district manager overview deane e driscoll drill operator age  was fatally injured on april   he was operating a drill positioned near the edge of a highwall bench when the drill tipped on its side driscoll was ejected from the operators cab and over the edge of the highwall the accident occurred because management procedures and controls were inadequate and failed to ensure that persons could safely operate the drill procedures had not been established specifying the grades and slopes where the drill could be safely operated consequently persons operating the drill were not adequately trained because this information had not been provided to them general information united mine an iron ore taconite mining operation owned and operated by united taconite llc was located in eveleth st louis county minnesota the principal operating official was todd d roth vice president and general manager the mine normally operated multiple shifts  hours a day  days a week total employment was  persons iron ore was mined from multiple benches and drilled blasted and removed from a multiple bench quarry the material was crushed and milled in a multiple step process the finished pellets were transported by rail to docks and shipped to steel manufacturing companies the last regular inspection of this mine was completed on march   description of accident on the day of the accident deane e driscoll victim reported for work at  am his normal starting time he was assigned a task to finish drilling a hole on the  bench referred to as hole number  he completed that task moved the drill and completed drilling hole numbers  and  about  am driscoll moved the drill to hole number  and began to raise and level the machine into position as the drill was positioned the drill end stabilizer jack on the noncab side failed resulting in the machine tipping down hill towards the highwall edge the drill continued tipping and came to rest approximately  degrees from vertical as the mast contacted the lower bench driscoll was ejected from the operators cab and landed on the lower bench approximately  feet below richard m keil fuel truck driver was enroute to the drill and saw the mast tipping he immediately radioed for help and began looking for driscoll several miners heard the call for help and assisted in the search emergency medical personnel arrived at the scene but driscoll was nonresponsive he was pronounced dead at the scene by the st louis county medical examiners deputy coroner death was attributed to massive trauma investigation of accident the mine safety and health administration msha was notified on april   at  pm by a telephone call from michael a anderson safety manager to mshas emergency hotline steven m richetta district manager was contacted and an investigation began the same day an order was issued pursuant to section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners mshas accident investigation team conducted a physical inspection of the accident site interviewed employees and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management employees the miners representatives and st louis county mine inspectors discussion location of the accident the accident occurred at the  bench referred to as the dairy queen hill area of the mine the drill was located near the edge of a bench where the ground sloped downward to the northeast drill the drill involved in the accident was an atlas copco model pit viper e drill it was crawlermounted and had a rotary drilling unit designed for blast hole drilling it was designed to drill  to inch diameter holes and had a singlepass depth capacity of  feet with a total depth capacity of  feet total machine weight was approximately  pounds drilling functions were hydraulically powered and compressed air was used to clean the hole a turbocharged  cylinder  hp qsk cummins engine powered a generator that in turn powered a  hp electric motor the electric motor was directly connected to a hydraulic pump drive gearbox on one end and an air compressor on the other end the hydraulic driven drill feed system was capable of  pounds of bit loading and had a maximum drill pullback force of  pounds a spur gear drive rotary head provided a maximum torque of  ftlbs the drill used four leveling jacks to keep it level and stable while drilling the drill tower was constructed of welded steel tubing a carouseltype drill rod changer that held two pieces of foot long drill rod was mounted to the tower the tower was raised and lowered by two hydraulic cylinders all drilling functions were controlled from the operators cab the machine could be moved from inside the cab and also remotely from outside the cab by means of a pendant control attached to the drill the drills operating safety and maintenance manual provided precautions and guidelines regarding operating the drill while it was in a level position reference  safety precautions and guidelines in the manual stated set up the drill on a level surface if this is not available the site should be adequately prepared prior to drill set up reference  specifications in the manual stated set up the pve blasthole drill on a level surface if this is not available prepare the site and the way to the site before set up and drilling with the pve leveling jack the leveling jack controls were single axis spring return to center levers with a mechanical lock that consisted of a collar on the control handle the collar on the handle had to be pulled upward to allow the control to move the three jack control levers were located on the operators left side each of the two leveling jacks on the drill end of the machine was controlled by a separate jack control lever the third jack control lever controlled both leveling jacks on the nondrill end of the machine the two nondrill end jacks shared a common hydraulic flow from a valve bank both leveling jacks received the same hydraulic pressure when the single jack control lever was moved to raise or lower them the nondrill end leveling jacks were not visible from the operators cab the machine was designed with an interlock that vented feed pressure for drilling unless the drill end leveling jacks were on the ground and were supporting the drill this feature would not allow the operator to drill unless both drill end jacks were down however there was not a similar interlock for the nondrilling end leveling jacks if one of the nondrill end jacks was fully extended and reached the end of its stroke hydraulic pressure and flow would continue to be supplied to the other nondrill end jack and potentially allow the fully extended jack to be lifted off the ground each hydraulic cylinder used to level the drill end of the machine was installed inside a cylindrical sleeve fastened to the frame of the machine a cap plate was fastened to the top of each of the cylinder sleeves using four hexhead bolts the bolts were grade  size ï¿½  x ï¿½ with a unc a thread a flange was welded to the top of each of the cylinder sleeves four holes through the flange lined up with four holes through the cap the four bolts passed vertically through the holes and each bolt was held with a nut on the bottom side a lock washer was installed under each nut when the leveling jacks were used to support the weight of the machine the rod end of the hydraulic cylinder inside each of the sleeves extended outward and pushed against the cap plate this caused the body of the hydraulic cylinder to extend downward and push against the ground the bottom of each cylinder was attached to a inch diameter jack pad to distribute the load onto the ground the hydraulic cylinders that leveled the machine on the nondrill end were similar in design a head frame was bolted on the top of the two lifting jack assemblies two tower rest support struts were attached between the head frame and the tower for tower stability each of the four hydraulic cylinders was doubleacting had a single rod and had throughtherodporting an unloader valve in the spool valve assembly limited the maximum working pressure to  psi the four hydraulic cylinders had a inch diameter bore a inch diameter rod and a inch stroke each hydraulic cylinder was provided with integral locking valves located inside the cylinder rod the locking valves operated by blocking fluid flow leaving the hydraulic cylinders unless pilot pressure was directed to the locking valve by actuating the leveling jack control lever to raise or lower the jacks whenever the control levers were in the neutral position the locking valve in each cylinder locked it in position by trapping a column of fluid in the hydraulic cylinders this kept the leveling jacks locked in position despite any hose failures or leakage without depending on pump pressure a second pilot line internal to the locking valve allowed for overpressure relief through the locking valve the overpressure relief setting was set at  to  psi overcoming this overpressure relief valve setting would require a load induced pressure of approximately  to  pounds concentrated on one leveling jack a significant portion of the stroke for each leveling jack consisted of free travel from the fully raised position to the point where ground contact was made by the jack pad with the machine on level ground the drill end jacks had a free travel of  inches and the nondrill end jacks  inches the effective working stroke was  inches for the drill end jacks and  inches for the nondrill end jacks the drill end jacks were  feet  inch apart and the nondrill end jacks were  feet  inches apart the fronttoback longitudinal distance between the drill end jacks and the nondrill end jacks was  feet  inches these dimensions were with respect to the jack centerlines leveling jack positioning at the time of the accident the main tower of the drill was found fully elevated and locked in position resting on the noncab side near the edge of a bench the drill end of the machine had a surveyed side slope of  degrees with the noncab side at the lower elevation the ground at the opposite end of the machine the nondrill end had a side slope of  degrees with the noncab side at the lower elevation the foreandaft slope elevations were  degrees on the cab side and  degrees on the noncab side with the drill end of the machine at the higher elevation investigators measured the extension of each leveling jack while the machine was resting on the noncab side but could not determine if the amount of cylinder extension changed after the machine started to tip over both nondrill end leveling jacks were fully extended at  inches the drill end noncab side leveling jack the one that failed was extended approximately  inches and the drill end cab side jack was extended  inches investigators determined the leveling jack at the nondrill noncab corner of the machine would not have been in contact with the ground based on the slope of the ground where the accident occurred and these cylinder extensions leveling jack failure investigators determined that the first of the four bolts failed at the noncab side drill end stabilizer jack during the midnight shift prior to the accident when the drill was in use at hole number  they found the failed bolt and a matching nut and lockwasher at hole number  after the accident but could not determine when the failure occurred on the midnight shift on this same shift the drill was moved and hole numbers  and  were completed and hole number  was started the accident occurred on the next shift day shift when the leveling jack assembly at the drill end noncab side corner of the machine collapsed as a result of the failure of the remaining three bolts holding the cap plate to the jack assembly cylinder sleeve based on examination of the four bolts three showed signs of fatigue where a small initial crack continually became larger over time due to a fluctuating load the remaining bolt failed in a more sudden fracture with no signs of fatigue after the four bolts failed the cap plate separated from the cylinder sleeve when this occurred the load bearing capacity of the leveling jack assembly was lost allowing the leveling jack assembly to collapse as a result the machine tipped over onto the noncab side of the machine the bolts were evaluated by an independent laboratory to determine hardness chemistry and microstructure the summary section of this report appendix b states the analysis of the bolts and bolt sections revealed the hardness was within specifications as provided by the manufacturer the elemental composition of the material was also within specifications as noted in astm a and also matches closely to that of the manufacturers testing data microstructural evaluation found that all four bolts had been quenched and tempered weather conditions weather conditions were clear with slight winds and a temperature of  degrees fahrenheit weather was not considered to be a factor in the accident training and experience deane e driscoll had  years and  weeks mining experience all at this mine he had approximately  years and  months experience as a drill operator and had received training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following causal factor was identified causal factor management policies and procedures were inadequate and failed to ensure that persons could safely operate the drill on slopes and grades that were compatible with the drills specifications and guidelines corrective action management should provide a stabilitygradeability chart and train all persons operating the drill to ensure the machine is operated as specified by the manufacturer conclusion the accident occurred because management procedures and controls were inadequate and failed to ensure that persons could safely operate the drill procedures were not established regarding the grades and slopes where the drill could be safely operated consequently persons operating the drill were not adequately trained enforcement actions order no  was issued on april   under the provisions of section k of the mine act a fatal accident occurred at this operation on april   when a miner was ejected from the cab of the drill he was operating when the stabilizer jack failed causing the machine to tip over this order was issued to assure the safety

room  dallas tx  edward e lopez district manager overview on april   alejandro e malo contract laborer age  was fatally injured when he fell about  feet from a scaffold malo was standing on a horizontal scaffold member passing scaffold materials to a coworker working above him the accident occurred because management policies failed to ensure that persons could safely erect scaffolds where there was a danger of falling the victim was not tied off and floorboards had been removed from the level of the scaffold where he was working additional considerations that might prevent future accidents include providing hand rails around all work platforms covering large openings in the floor while working above them and hoisting materials to elevated work locations general information arkansas operations mill a surface alumina mill owned and operated by almatis inc was located in bauxite saline county arkansas the principal operating official was dinesh moorjani operations manager the mill operated multiple shifts  hours a day  days per week total employment was  persons alumina oxide was shipped by rail to the mill from several sources the alumina oxide was conveyed to the mill where it was further refined to produce various grades of alumina oxide for industrial uses parish abatement co parish located in donaldson hot spring county arkansas was an asbestos remediation contractor the principal operating official was larry parish owner parish worked almost exclusively at almatis performing a variety of projects on the day of accident parish had been contracted to erect two scaffolds for use by another contractor a regular inspection was in progress when the accident occurred description of accident on the day of the accident larry parish arrived at the mill about  am he and his crew planned to erect two scaffolds on the fifth floor of building  each scaffold was to consist of two foothigh sections set on top of each other one scaffold was to be situated over a foot by foot opening in the fifth floor walking surface that opening was directly above similar openings in the fourth third and second floors of the building parish had alejandro malo victim and joel mendoza construction worker pick up some materials that morning before coming to the mill they arrived at the mill about  am malo and mendoza attended a safety meeting where larry parish discussed  percent tieoff with them and caleb parish construction worker larry parish then directed malo to rig scaffold materials to be hoisted from the ground floor to the fifth floor of building  larry parish mendoza and caleb parish went to the fifth floor of building  to receive the materials and erect the two scaffolds malo continued to hoist materials from the ground floor until about  pm when he walked up the stairs to the fifth floor to help complete the scaffolds one scaffold had been completed and the second scaffold only needed hand rails around the top level the floor boards at the foot level of each scaffold had been removed and placed on the foot level of each respective scaffold as had been their work practice at almatis for several years almatis personnel that routinely checked on contractors had not instructed parish to do otherwise in the past and had not checked on them during the day of the accident almatis employees who were working on the ground level of building  were subject to injury from tools equipment or materials that could have fallen through the floor openings over which one scaffold was built almatis management failed to take action to ensure parish covered the floor opening mendoza was standing on the foot level of the incomplete scaffold to receive materials to complete the hand rails larry parish directed malo to climb to the foot level of the scaffold and pass materials to mendoza malo who was wearing a full body harness with two lanyards reportedly climbed up using  percent tieoff he then stood on a horizontal member of the scaffold structure still tied off malo took an foot hand rail section from larry parish and passed it up to mendoza larry parish then turned to get another section of hand rail from the floor behind him and heard malo yell he turned and saw that malo had fallen into the large opening on the fifth floor mendoza and caleb parish who had been passing materials from the materials hoist to larry parish also heard the yell but did not see malo fall larry parish called ken zuber guard at  pm who then called the plant alert team and emergency medical services larry parish mendoza and caleb parish went down the stairs to the second floor they found malo lying on a cable tray and conduit pipes about  feet above the ground floor christopher white alert team member quickly arrived and attended to malo who was nonresponsive emergency medical services arrived about  pm and malo was pronounced dead at  pm by the saline county coroner the cause of death was listed as multiple injuries investigation of accident on the day of the accident msha was notified at  pm by a telephone call from rusty griffin environmental heath and safety specialist to mshas emergency hotline fred gatewood assistant district manager was notified and an investigation was started the same day an order was issued pursuant to section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of miners while having no bearing on the cause of the accident a citation was issued for the failure to immediately contact msha and report the accident mshas accident investigation team traveled to the mine made a physical inspection of the accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and employees contractor management and employees and the miners representative discussion location of accident the accident occurred on the fifth floor of building  where two scaffolds were being erected the victim was standing on a horizontal scaffold support located on the foot level of the second scaffold the weather was warm and dry with temperatures reaching  degrees fahrenheit scaffolds each of the two scaffolds to be erected was to consist of two foot vertical sections stacked on top of each other one scaffold had been completed and the other scaffold only needed hand rails around the top level to complete it sixinch pads were placed under the corners of each scaffold to provide stability each foot section of the scaffolds was  feet long and  feet wide and was constructed by connecting inch diameter steel tubing sections that were equipped with snaplocks to hold them together vertical tubing sections had inch metal rings around the circumference at inch intervals each ring had eight holes to accept the pins that secured the different configurations of hand railing bracing supports and floorboards the floorboards consisted of common lumber pieces  inches high by  inches wide by  feet long floorboards had been placed at the foot level of each scaffold as they were erected but were removed and placed on the foot level after those support members had been installed a fixed ladder had been erected on the outside of the incomplete scaffold it was placed near a corner away from the completed scaffold the ladder was three feet short of reaching the foot level and was not in use at the time of the accident fall protection at the time of the accident malo and mendoza were each wearing fall protection larry parish and caleb parish who were standing on the fifth floor walking surface were not wearing fall protection they had removed their fall protection just prior to lunch and did not put it back on afterward larry parish caleb parish and mendoza each had a phoenix model fullbody harness manufactured by tracletfallstop which was designed for persons weighing up to  pounds the harnesses were equipped with two foot lanyards manufactured by ao safety malo was wearing a fullbody harness manufactured by elk river designed for persons weighing up to  pounds it was equipped with two foot shockabsorbing lanyards manufactured by elk river the harness and lanyards worn by malo were inspected and no defects were found training and experience larry parish malo and mendoza had worked as individual contractors at the mill for about  years when almatis inc bought the mill from the previous owner about two years ago larry parish formed parish abatement co and hired malo and mendoza in june  larry parish hired caleb parish all four individuals had received training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following root causes were identified root cause management policies and procedures were inadequate and failed to ensure that persons could safely erect scaffolds floorboards were not maintained at the foot level of the scaffold where persons were directed to perform work corrective action management should establish policies and procedures for erecting scaffolds safely floorboards should be provided at all levels where persons will work prior to beginning work possible risks should be discussed and procedures should be established to safely complete the task root cause management policies and work procedures failed to ensure that fall protection was properly used by persons working where there was a danger of falling corrective action management should establish policies and procedures that ensure fall protection is used continuously by all persons working where there is a danger of falling management should evaluate the use of retractable lanyard mechanisms that enable users to change positions without unfastening and reconnecting the lanyard conclusion the accident occurred because management policies failed to ensure that persons could safely erect scaffolds where there was a danger of falling the victim was not tied off and floorboards had been

the other miner was able to rescue himself a crane positioned on shore and the boat were being used to recover an anchor the crane cable and boat were simultaneously hooked to the anchor line the crane operators view of the boat was obstructed and no communications had been established between the crews because there was too much slack in the cable the crane backed away from the shore capsizing the boat neither of the employees on the boat were wearing the life jackets that were available on the boat the accident occurred because the mine operator did not ensure that effective procedures were used to protect persons attempting to recover the dredge anchor the operator failed to ensure that a method of visual contact or verbal communications was established between the crane operator and the employees on the boat general information south state inc dredge plant a sand and gravel operation owned and operated by south state inc was located east of bridgeton cumberland county new jersey the principal operating officials were chester j ottinger jr president shirley t chichura secretarytreasurer and roger a smith plant managersafety director the mine operated one eighthour shift a day five days a week total employment was  persons sand and gravel was mined from a pond using a dredging machine the material was pumped to a plant where it was crushed screened and stockpiled the finished products were used in the construction industry the last regular inspection conducted by msha at this mine was on november   description of accident on the day of the accident elwood durham victim reported to work at approximately  am his regular duties included operating the plant loading trucks and conducting maintenance activities as needed durham met with david g spoltore quality control technician howard e gandy foreman and christopher biscoglio dredge operator to discuss the days activities at approximately  am gandy biscoglio and durham went to the dredge to conduct repairs at approximately  am they entered a workboat and traveled to the southeast area of the dredge pond to free and retrieve a dredge anchor that broke away from the dredge last fall the anchor was located  feet from the southeast shore line at a depth of approximately  feet none of the miners were wearing a life jacket the employees attached a cable tag line to the anchor and to a pontoon on the surface they used a ton overhead chain hoist mounted to an aframe at the front of the workboat to hook into an eyelet on the anchor tag line to hoist the anchor free after making several unsuccessful attempts to pull the anchor free they returned to shore at  pm the employees decided to use a ton mobile crane to assist in retrieving the anchor durham and biscoglio boarded the workboat and traveled to the anchor pontoon neither person was wearing a life jacket at  pm roger a smith plant manager arrived at the west side of the dredge pond and observed durham and biscoglio  feet off shore traveling towards the anchor pontoon at  pm david g spoltore arrived and discussed the days activities with smith gandy gathered a foot long cable sling and drove the crane to the southeast shore line of the pond he placed the crane against a foot high berm on the north side of the road but could not see the workboat from the cranes operator cab durham and biscoglio attached the chain hoist hook of the workboat to the anchor tag line causing the bow of the workboat to tilt towards the water they attached one end of the cable sling to the crane lifting hook and the other end of the cable sling to the same eyelet in the anchor tag line that the workboats chain hoist hook was attached gandy retracted the crane cable until the cranes lifting hook was against the boom he raised the extended boom to take up the excess slack in the cable after raising the boom to capacity gandy exited the operators cab and yelled to durham and biscoglio that he would have to reposition the crane to take up the additional slack in the cable gandy then retracted the boom all the way in and lowered it to just above the berm while the crane backed up toward the east the workboat capsized throwing durham and biscoglio into the water about  pm smith and spoltore still at the west shore heard screaming coming from the boat and saw it capsizing smith ran to an adjacent sand stockpile yelled and motioned for gandy to stop the crane smith and spoltore traveled to the accident site biscoglio swam to the capsized boat and climbed on top of it he held durhams head above the water until the boat suddenly sank biscoglio used the cable sling attached to the crane to pull him to shore once ashore he observed durham floating face down in the frigid water spoltore called for emergency medical assistance while smith and gandy went into the water and pulled durham to the shore smith and gandy assessed durhams vital signs and started cpr smith and biscoglio were transported to the hospital where they were treated for hypothermia and released durham was airlifted by helicopter to the hospital where he died as a result of his injuries on march   investigation of the accident msha was notified of the accident at  am on march   by a telephone call from roger a smith plant manager to robert lcarter supervisory mine inspector an investigation was started the same day an order was issued pursuant to section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners mshas accident investigation team traveled to the mine conducted a physical investigation of the accident site interviewed employees and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management employees new jersey department of labor and the new jersey state police discussion location of the accident the accident occurred on the mine dredge pond approximately  feet from the south east shore line the manmade fresh water pond was an oval shaped dredging excavation encompassing approximately  acres with an average depth of  feet the bank was composed of sedimentary deposits of sand and gravel with a roadway adjacent to the perimeter the top of the near vertical bank was approximately  feet above the narrow shore line a foot high berm was provided on the north side of the road way weather conditions the weather on the day of the accident was clear with moderate winds and an average air temperature of  degrees fahrenheit the water was calm with a temperature of approximately  degrees fahrenheit crane the rubbertired mobile crane was a  broderson manufacturing corporation bcm model rtra with a maximum rated lifting capacity of  pounds  tons the crane hook had a maximum vertical lift height of approximately  feet and a horizontal extend and retract range of approximately  feet the hoist block was rigged with a part line the piece boom was not equipped with a jib extension the top of the operators cab measured  feet  ï¿½ inches from ground level this factor contributed to the crane operators inability to see the employees and boat at the time of the accident workboat the workboat was fabricated locally it had a flat deck and flat bottom with no keel the operators station was located at the stern of the vessel the boat was equipped with an inboard fourcylinder whitecontinental gasoline engine and a mechanically operated rudder for steering the pound boat had an overall length of  feet an overall width of  ï¿½ feet and a hull height of  feet water marks on the side of the boat indicated that normal freeboard of the boat was approximately  inches the hull of the boat was enclosed except for an engine compartment opening at the stern a tripod aframe hoist mechanism was mounted on the bow portion of the boat perimeter hand rails were only provided from amidships aft to the stern the vessel had no builtin floatation three life jackets were provided on the boat dredge anchor the anchor was fabricated locally with two large flukes and a stock and tripping pan a large crane was used to recover the anchor and boat according to a scale on the crane the anchor weighed approximately  pounds an pound force was needed to free the anchor from the bottom of the pond anchor and pontoon rigging a steel pontoon  feet long and  feet in diameter was attached to a wire cable and to the anchor to mark the location and provide a connection to the anchor the wire cable was approximately  feet long and had three eyelets spaced at  feet  feet and  feet from where it was connected to the pontoon the eyelets provided places to connect a recovery line to pull the anchor out of the water cable sling a wire rope cable sling  feet long and  inch in diameter was connected to an eyelet of the anchor recovery line using a shackled connection the other end was attached to the crane lifting hook workboat hoist and rigging the apex of the tripod aframe located on the bow front of the boat was  ï¿½ feet above the deck a jet l ton capacity chain hoist was mounted to the apex of the aframe structure the hoist hook was attached and tensioned to the same eyelet of the recovery line that the cable sling from the crane was shackled to crane set up there were no communication devices to allow employees in the workboat to communicate with the crane operator the crane operator could not see or talk with the employees from the operators cab the position of the right front corner of the crane cab was approximately  feet from the top edge of the bank the berm in front of the cranes operator cab was  feet high the water level was  feet below the elevation of the access road and the anchor pontoon was approximately  feet from the bank an estimated line of sight of the crane operator was  feet above the boats aframe apex the closest point on the surface of the water that would have been visible to the crane operator would have been at least  feet from the bank see appendix b training and experience elwood durham had  years  weeks mining experience all at this mine he had received training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following causal factors were identified causal factor the method used to rig the workboat hoist the recovery cable and the cable sling connected to the crane made it inevitable that tension applied by the crane would cause the boat to capsize the rigging needed to be disconnected from the workboat to safely complete the task corrective action conduct a thorough risk assessment before starting a task to ensure that all hazards are evaluated and eliminated causal factor direct communications between the workboat personnel and the crane operator was not maintained to complete a task requiring constant coordination and communication corrective action ensure that communications are in place when tasks are performed that require two separate crews use a spotter if visual contact cannot be maintained at all times between the crane operator and the workboat crew causal factor neither employee on the workboat was wearing the life jackets provided on the workboat at the time of the accident corrective action ensure that life jackets are worn at all times where there is a danger of falling into the water conclusion the accident occurred because the mine operator did not ensure that effective procedures were used to protect persons attempting to recover the dredge anchor the operator failed to ensure that a method of visual contact or verbal communications was established between the crane operator and the employees on the boat neither of the employees on the boat were wearing the life jackets that were available on the boat enforcement actions order no  was issued on march   under the provisions of section k of the mine act an accident occurred at this operation on march   when two miners fell into the frigid dredging pond water this order is issued to assure the safety of persons at this operation and prohibits any work in the affected area and on the rubbertired broderson crane until msha determines that it is safe to resume normal operations as determined by an authorized representative of the secretary of labor the mine operator shall obtain approval from an authorized representative for all actions to recover andor restore operations in the affected areas this order was terminated on march   conditions and procedures that contributed to the accident have been corrected the workboat broderson crane and the work area where the accident occurred to include the shore line where the accident victims were extricated from the water were allowed to return to normal mining operations citation no  was issued on march   under the provisions of section d of the mine act for violations of  on march   a  year old plant operator was fatally injured when a workboat he and another coworker were on capsized the plant operator died from his injuries on march   neither employee was wearing a life jacket although there were life jackets on the boat the workboat had handrails on three sides but not in the front where the victim was standing when it capsized the boat was not equipped with floatation and the water was  degrees f a foreman with south state was on shore directing activities and had observed the employees on the workboat without life jackets he also was with them on the boat earlier in the day as they worked without wearing life jackets at the time of the accident the employees and foreman were trying to raise a  pound anchor to the companys dredge they had attached a chain to the anchor line which was connected to the workboat and a wire rope from the anchor line to a mobile crane operated by the foreman on the shore the workboat capsized when the foreman backed up the crane in an attempt to pull the anchor free without disconnecting the chain to the workboat he could not see the workboat from the crane as he backed up the company engaged in aggravated conduct constituting more than ordinary negligence in that they were aware of the employees failure to wear life jackets while engaged in work tasks that had a high risk of destabilizing or capsizing the boat on which the employees were working they did so despite the additional danger that the water body was deep and frigid this violation is an unwarrantable failure to comply with a mandatory standard this citation was terminated on march   standard  of the  cfr was reviewed with mine management and the miners

street room  duluth mn  steven m richetta district manager overview david a randall laborer age  was fatally injured on may   when he was struck by a steel plate while loading it onto a flatbed truck a frontend loader was used to lift the plate with a chain hook while randall steadied the plate with his hand standing on the edge of the truck bed as the plate was lowered into the truck bed it detached from the hook both randall and the plate fell to the ground and the plate crushed him the accident occurred because the procedures and equipment used to load the steel plate were inadequate the victim had to stand in the bed of the truck and guide the suspended plate by hand because the rigging system that was used did not control the steel plate general information plant # was a portable crushing plant owned and operated by michels pipeline construction incorporated at the time of the accident the crusher was located at the kewaskum pit about five miles south of kewaskum washington county wisconsin the principal operating official was patrick d michels president the mine normally operated one hour shift per day five days per week total employment was three persons sand and gravel material was mined from a single bench with a frontend loader the mined material was fed into a crusher and conveyed to stockpiles the finished product was loaded into customer trucks with a frontend loader it was sold for use in the construction industry the last regular inspection at this operation was completed on february   description of the accident on the day of the accident david a randall victim reported for work about  am to help transport the portable plant to a new mining location randall asked william edwards loader operator to help load four steel plates onto a flatbed truck randall attached one end of a chain hook to the bucket of a frontend loader and the other end to the plate the hook was placed in a hole that had been cut out of the plate edwards lifted the plate with the frontend loader while randall steadied the plates by hand as they were moved approximately  feet to the flatbed truck randall then climbed into the bed of the truck he guided the plate as edwards lowered it vertically onto its edge into the truck bed randall signaled to edwards to lower the frontend loaders boom to slacken the chain he then pushed the plate toward the opposite side of the truck until the plate leaned on the hook edwards lowered the plate onto the bed of the truck with the frontend loaders boom control the first two plates were loaded into the flatbed truck without incident at  am randall hooked the third plate and steadied it by hand as the frontend loader lifted and moved it to the truck edwards aligned the frontend loader so the steel plate was suspended parallel with the drivers side of the truck randall climbed into the corner of the bed that was nearest the drivers seat and directed edwards to lower the plate edwards lowered the plate until it stood on its edge in the bed of the truck randall steadied the plate and signaled edwards to continue lowering until there was slack in the chain as the plate lowered the hook came out of the hole and it became unstable randall attempted to wrestle the plate into the truck bed but both he and the plate fell to the ground edwards sounded the frontend loaders horn to get the attention of coworkers mark enright foreman and tony bukowski and kevin sheehan heavy equipment operators were in the pit area assisting with the move heard the crash and horn and ran to the side of the flatbed truck they attached the hook and chain to the plate and edwards used the frontend loader to lift the plate off randall enright called for emergency medical assistance emergency medical personnel arrived and randall was pronounced dead at  am by the county medical examiner death was attributed to crushing injuries investigation of the accident msha was notified of the accident at  am edt on may   by a telephone call from ralph miller safety coordinator to paul a blome supervisory mine safety and health inspector an investigation was started that day an order was issued under the provisions of section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners mshas accident investigators traveled to the mine made a physical inspection at the accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management employees and the wisconsin department of commerce discussion location of the accident the accident occurred near the center of the pit about  feet south and west of the recently mined pit walls the pit floor was dry level and relatively flat weather the weather was not considered to be a factor with sunny skies light winds and a temperature of  degrees frontend loader the frontend loader used to load the steel plates was a  caterpillar model g the  pound loader was powered by a  hp caterpillar model c dita diesel engine investigators conducted an operational check of the loaders steering braking and hydraulic systems and no defects were found flatbed truck the flatbed truck that the steel plates were being loaded on was a  international model dt e the trucks front axle load rating was  pounds and the rear axle was  pounds giving the truck a gross vehicle weight rating of  pounds the truck had a steel bed with inch steel side rails around the outside edge the bed measured  feet long by  feet  inches wide inside the rails the height from the top of the bed to the ground was approximately  inches no defects were found with the truck chain the chain  feet long from the inside connection to the hooks was a  inch grade  with a grab hook on one end and a slip hook on the other end the chain did not fail and did not appear to have been damaged during the accident both hooks were  inch alloy with clevistype ends for attachment to the chain the width of the throat of the slip hook was approximately ï¿½ inches and the distance from the bottom of the throat to the tip of the hook was approximately  inches the slip hook had a predrilled hole for the attachment of a safety latch but it did not have a safety latch the chain manufacturer recommends that a slingtype hook be used instead of a slip hook in lifting applications the chain assembly had a tag indicating a maximum working load limit of  pounds which is the same as the limit on the hooks used in the assembly the amount of weight being lifted at the time of the accident was less than  percent of the maximum working load limit of the chain steel plates when the plant was running four steel plates were placed against the crusher trailer serving as barriers to keep material from accumulating under the trailer the plate that fell on the victim was approximately  feet wide  feet long ï¿½ inches thick and weighed  pounds a  inch wide x  inch long hole had been cut approximately ï¿½ inches from the edge of one of the long sides of each plate to assist in loading the ï¿½ inch dimension was parallel to the long edge of the plate and the inch dimension was perpendicular to the long side of the plate signaling reportedly standard lifting signals were used at this operation the victim signaled edwards with hand and head gestures to indicate the desired direction to move the plate the chain was long enough to keep the loader operators view unobstructed by the bucket as the victim signaled from the truck bed rigging and loading each plate was lifted moved and lowered by a frontend loader using a chain that was attached to the bucket by looping it through a clevis on the bucket tilt mechanism and attaching the grab hook to one of the chain links the slip hook on the other end of the chain was hooked into a hole in the edge of each plate each plate was lifted in the vertical position and moved to the flatbed truck as the victim steadied the plate by hand the plate was lifted above the flatbed and lowered until it was standing on its edge on the truck bed the victim would stand on the front drivers side corner of the flatbed and direct the loader operator to lower the bucket until the chain slackened randall would push against the top of the plate until the plate leaned in the opposite direction against the hook and chain he would then direct the loader operator to lower the bucket until the plate was lying flat on the truck bed during the lifting procedure the loader operator placed the bucket in the dump position so the cutting edge of the bucket did not contact the chain the boom lift control was used to raise and lower the plates the rigging method used did not provide a means to prevent the slip hook from coming loose when slack was allowed in the chain since the plates being loaded did not have any taglines the victim had to steady and guide the plates by positioning himself close enough to the plate so he could place his hand on it the end of the chain attached to the loader bucket did not show signs of slippage during the accident sequence training and experience david randall had  years  months of total mining experience he had received training in accordance with  cfr part  he helped move plants to new mining locations and into the shop for maintenance and repairs approximately two to three times a week the loader operator had  years experience and loaded plates approximately five times a year usually into dump truck beds portable plant # was moved  to  times per year root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following causal factor was identified causal factor management policies and controls were inadequate procedures were not in place to ensure suitable hitches slings and tag lines were used to load the steel plate into the truck bed the hook came out of the hole in the plate as it was loaded onto the truck corrective action perform a risk assessment to identify and eliminate or control any hazards discuss what could go wrong and identify locations where miners should not be positioned to eliminate hazards from suspended loads use a tag line to control the load from a safe location ensure that rigging suitable for the load being lifted has been provided hooks should have safety latches that close the throat opening and secure the suspended load conclusion the accident occurred because the mine operator did not ensure that effective procedures and equipment were utilized to protect persons assigned to load steel plates the victim stood in the bed of the truck and guided the suspended plate by hand because no rigging system was provided to safely hoist and position the plate into the truck bed violations order no  was issued on may   under the provisions of section k of the mine act a fatal accident occurred at this operation may   when two miners were attempting to load four ï¿½inch steel plates inches wide inches long ï¿½inch thick all of the plates were approximately the same size in the face area of the pit the crew and two extra men were in the process of moving the plant and equipment to the next designated site this order is issued to assure the safety of all persons at this operation it prohibits all activity at this operation michels corp plant # until msha has determined that it is safe to resume normal operation at this site the mine operator shall obtain prior approval from an authorized representative for all actions to recover and or restore operations to the affected area this order was

lhd and truck they moved a roof bolter in to start the bolting cycle harding went to another area of the mine and johnson set up to begin bolting about  pm johnson left his work area and went to the surface on his way back to the work area johnson met harding and told him the feed cable came off the roof bolter they also discussed that the drift could not be drilled and blasted again because it needed shotcreted before advancing johnson returned to the work area repaired the cable feed and resumed bolting on august   at about  am daniel j bailey mechanic came to the drift to perform maintenance on the roof bolter he completed the repairs and left about  am at approximately  am the crew assembled on the surface at the end of shift johnson was unaccounted for so rodney keller miner went back to the  drift to look for him keller telephoned the surface saying the roof bolter was buried and he could not locate johnson mine rescue crews were summoned and recovery efforts were started immediately the ground in front of the fall was rebolted and material was removed from the left side of the roof bolter using a remote controlled lhd the roof bolter was pushed to the left and material was removed from the right side johnson was recovered and pronounced dead at  am on august   by a local physician the cause of death was blunt force trauma investigation of the accident the mine safety and health administration msha was notified of the accident at  am on august   by a telephone call from brad wigglesworth turquoise ridge mine safety coordinator to the national call center diane watson acting assistant district manager was notified and recovery efforts began the same day an order was issued under the provisions of section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners mshas accident investigation team traveled to the mine conducted a physical inspection of the accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management employees and the county coroners office discussion location of the accident the accident occurred in the  development drift the face of the drift was approximately  feet from the last intersection mining began in this heading on august   geology gold ore was produced from the primary mineralization in the footwall of the getchell fault and followed both structure and replacement of favorable beds the original host rocks were limestone and carbonaterich mudstones which were highly sheared and metamorphosed prior to mineralization the host rocks had bedding planes joints and shears due to folding these features were orientated at various angles to each other ground structures encountered were footwall splays of the getchell fault this type of ground condition near the getchell fault had been difficult to control when it was previously encountered roof bolter the roof bolter used to install bolts on the day of the accident was an electrohydraulic tamrock robolt d xl the roof bolter had a single boom which incorporated an indexing mechanism one position was used for drilling and another for bolt installation the machine had a carrousel for automatic bolt handling the roof bolter was designed to install foot split set roof bolts the operators compartment was equipped with a falling object protective structure fops canopy ground support plan typical ground support consisted of  mm or  mm foot long split sets with inch dome plates when needed foot by foot panels of  gauge welded wire mesh with a inch grid and shotcrete were used the ground control plan for the mine required additional supports for adverse conditions twelvefoot rounds were being taken in the drift where the accident occurred the ground was being supported with foot long mm split sets inch dome plates and inch square  gauge wire mesh split sets were installed on a foot by foot spacing the foot by foot mesh panels were overlapped at least one foot when installed with this configuration the bolt spacing was not more than  feet fall of ground the fall of ground occurred in the  drift that was driven feet wide and feet high the drift was approaching the getchell fault and management was anticipating deteriorating ground conditions when the previous round was mined a fault was detected on the left rib and the bolter operator began to bolt and install mesh to approximately three feet from the bottom of the left side rib using foot split sets and welded wire mesh for additional support a joint was observed on the right side of the drift that paralleled the fault this joint appeared to be affecting the shape of the arch that started to become more angular at the apex as mining progressed a second joint was observed within a short distance from where the fall cavity began investigators conducted a laser cavity survey of the fall area and estimated that  tons of material fell the fall was approximately  feet high at its apex training and experience curtis l johnson had seven years mining experience he had  ï¿½ years experience operating a roof bolter at this mine and had been trained in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following causal factor was identified causal factor management policies and procedures were inadequate and failed to ensure that persons could safely install ground supports the mines ground control plan was not followed when ground conditions were encountered that required additional support persons were not trained to evaluate and support adverse ground conditions corrective action management should establish procedures to ensure that supervisors or other designated persons examine ground conditions in areas where work is to be performed after blasting and as ground conditions warrant during the shift persons should be trained to evaluate and support adverse ground conditions conclusion the accident occurred because management procedures and controls were inadequate and failed to ensure that persons could safely install ground supports the ground control plan was not followed when ground conditions were encountered that required additional support persons were not trained to evaluate and support adverse ground conditions enforcement actions order no  was issued on august   under the provisions of section k of the mine act a serious accident occurred at this operation on august   when portions of the back and rib fell in on top of a bolter in the  drift this

procedures were not followed the utility water truck was left unattended on a grade the parking brake was not set and the wheels were not chocked or turned into the rib general information intrepid potash east an underground potash mine and surface processing plant owned by intrepid potash nm llc was located about  miles east of carlsbad new mexico the principal operating official was dick heinen manager of mines the mine operated two hour shifts per day seven days per week total employment was  persons potash was mined from underground bedded deposits using continuous miners mined material was conveyed to a shaft where it was skiphoisted to the surface on the surface the ore was crushed ground and screened and impurities were removed finished products were shipped to customers by railcar or truck the last regular inspection at this operation was completed on september   description of the accident on the day of the accident brian p marrs victim reported for work at  am his normal starting time his regular duties included starting the water pump at the shaft operating a dozer to muck along the conveyor belt and pumping water from the sumps located adjacent to the st  roadway marrs typically pumped mine water from small sumps into the tank on a utility water truck the water was discharged to a larger sump located closer to the shaft at the beginning of the shift leroy ross belt supervisor told marrs to pump water the entire shift in the st  section marrs took a utility water truck to the  section of the mine and began pumping water about  pm james hicks electrical supervisor saw marrs utility water truck parked at the intersection of bt and rm he saw marrs standing at the electrical transformer station located in bt about  pm steve thatcher scoop operator was driving a scoop toward the st  conveyor head roller and  conveyor tail pulley while passing bt thatcher saw marrs utility water truck but did not see marrs the utility water truck was positioned about  feet northeast of its last observed location thatcher stopped and walked around the utility water truck looking for marrs he called out to marrs but got no response thatcher then walked around the utility water truck and saw marrs on the ground beneath the right front tire thatcher checked marrs but he was unresponsive thatcher went to the  mine office to call for help meanwhile ross was traveling west in west  roadway when he saw the utility water truck parked ross began looking for marrs and found him on the ground beneath the right front tire of the utility water truck ross was unable to detect vital signs traveled to the  mine office and met thatcher who was already calling for emergency medical assistance marrs was pronounced dead at the scene by rick wiedenmann office of medical investigation death was attributed to traumatic asphyxia investigation of the accident msha was notified of the accident at  pm march   by a telephone call from dale janway manager of safety to larry parks supervisory mine safety and health inspector an investigation was started that day an order was issued pursuant to section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners mshas accident investigation team traveled to the mine made a physical inspection of the accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and employees discussion location of the accident the accident occurred in the st  roadway about  feet northeast of the bt  and rm intersection in the underground portion of the mine the roadway in this area was straight although it was wet and muddy with a few ruts it was about  feet wide  feet high and had a  percent grade utility water truck the utility water truck involved in the accident was a  elmac with an articulated frame it was powered by a deutz model flw engine and consisted of a water tank unit and an engine unit the water tank unit was  feet long and  feet wide and was connected at the articulation joint to the engine unit which was  feet long and  feet  inches wide the truck was considered to be moving forward when the engine unit was leading the operators compartment was located on the right side of the truck on the engine unit near the articulation joint area the operators seat was perpendicular to the direction of travel the hydraulic steering cylinders were controlled by a lever in the operators compartment the transmission had three forward and three reverse speeds the two wheels on the engine unit received power from the engine through the transmission and torque converter the two wheels on the water tank were not powered the engine stop control was found pulled outward  ï¿½ inches which was the engine stopped position the transmission gear shift control was found in third gear reverse the accelerator pedal was found in the low idle position the engine started and ran smoothly and would stop when the engine shutdown knob was pulled outward  ï¿½ inches or more the knob stayed in position after being pulled the axle of the engine unit was equipped with service and parking brakes but the axle of the water tank unit was not equipped with either neither the service brakes nor the parking brakes had any defects that would have contributed to the accident service brakes the service brake system consisted of an airoperated twoshoe internalexpanding drum type arrangement at each of the two wheels on the engine unit the axle on the engine unit was equipped with type  brake chambers and manuallyadjusted slack adjusters each brake chamber was comprised of two separate chambers coupled together into one unit to serve two separate functions the forward chamber provided service braking capability and the rear chamber provided parking brake capability when compressed air entered the service brake chambers the pushrods extended from the chambers and applied the service brake parking brakes the rear portion of each brake chamber on the engine unit provided parking brake capability without compressed air in the parking brake portion a selfcontained spring expanded extending the pushrod and applying the parking brake automatically the parking brake could be applied manually with the pushpull parking brake valve in the operators cab pushing the parking brake control down set the brake and pulling the control up released the brake the parking brake control was found in the released position brake and steering system testing a series of performance tests were conducted where the utility water truck was found after the accident to duplicate the conditions at the time of the accident the engine was shut down the park brake control knob was placed in the released position the transmission was placed in reverse third gear and the empty water tank unit was positioned downgrade relative to the engine unit tests were repeated at the same location but with the engine running the truck was then moved  feet upgrade where witnesses reported seeing it prior to the accident tests were again conducted with and without the engine running the results of all the tests showed that when neither the service brake nor the parking brake was applied the vehicle would usually coast downgrade application of only the service brake would stop and hold the vehicle in all cases application of only the parking brake would stop and hold the vehicle in all cases the elapsed time from activation of the parking brake control knob to application of the brake linings against the drum was approximately two seconds whether the engine was running or not once the brake linings made contact with the drum the truck stopped almost immediately the steering was tested while the utility water truck was moving and no defects were found the accelerator pedal was tested and would not spring return upon release to the low idle position whether the engine was running or stopped however this defect did not contribute to the accident training and experience brian p marrs had worked at this mine for  years and  weeks he had received all training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following causal factor was identified causal factor administrative controls needed improvement the victim left the water truck unattended and failed to set the parking brake the truck was parked on a grade and the wheels were not chocked or turned into the rib corrective action procedures should be implemented to monitor mobile equipment parking procedures the procedures should ensure that mobile equipment operators set the parking brake of unattended mobile equipment and if parked on a grade chock the wheels or turn them into the rib conclusion the accident occurred because safe operating procedures were not followed the utility water truck was left unattended on a grade the parking brake was not set and the wheels were not chocked or turned into the rib enforcement actions order no  was issued on october   under the provisions of section k of the mine act a fatal

june   gervarius m dickey victim reported to work at  am his normal starting time dickey and jon windham scraper operators inspected their scrapers and fueled them they drove to the stripping area where they met hubert ramsey dozer operator normal stripping operations required the dozer to push the scrapers through the loading cycle to assist filling them the scrapers then hauled the dirt material to the driveover stockpile where the material was dumped as the pan traversed the length of the stockpile stripping proceeded normally until  am when ramsey told dickey and windham to start another stockpile two hundred yards east of the previous stockpile they dumped at the new location until  pm when they took a lunch break after lunch they continued stockpiling at the new location ramsey was positioning his dozer to push windhams scraper when he glanced toward the old stockpile he saw dickeys scraper overturn and dickey fall from the cab the scraper continued to roll over onto its left side pinning dickey underneath ramsey immediately drove to the accident site windham observed the dozer moving toward the old dump area and saw the scraper on its side but couldnt see dickey ramsey waved to windham stopped his machine and ran to the overturned scraper ramsey found dickey on his back under the left rear portion of the rollover protective structure rops he and windham

ensure the safety of miners mshas accident investigators traveled to the mine made a physical inspection of the accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and employees discussion accident location the accident occurred in the pit area on a finished stockpile that was approximately  feet long  feet wide and zero to  ï¿½ feet high the stockpile ran in a west to east direction the stockpile was built with sand and gravel hauled from the pit by two pan scrapers routine procedure for building the stockpiles had the scrapers eject the material from the pan as they drove across the pile the pan scraper had accessed the stockpile from the east end and had traveled about  feet along the south edge of the stockpile where it overturned at this area the average width of the stockpile was  feet and the height was about  ï¿½ feet berms guard rails or similar impeding devices had not been provided nor maintained along the edges of the stockpile pan scraper the wheel tractorscraper involved in the accident was a caterpillar model f manufactured in  the scraper weighed approximately  tons and had a maximum payload of  cubic yards it was empty at the time of the accident the scraper was powered by a  hp caterpillar model c  cylinder turbocharged and aftercooled diesel engine connected to an automatic transmission with  forward speeds neutral and reverse the scraper was manufactured with a rops and equipped with seat belts both items were properly maintained the pan scraper was equipped with service secondary and parking brake systems but was not equipped with an optional retarder a pedal in the operators compartment supplied air pressure to the brake actuators canisters to engage the s camoperated expanding shoe and drum service brakes at each of the scrapers four wheels the front and rear wheel service brakes were independent circuits the secondary and parking brake systems engaged the same brake shoes at all four wheels as applied by the service brakes however this system applied the brakes by springs contained in the secondaryparking brake section of the brake canisters the secondaryparking brakes were released by using air pressure to compress the springs the system had an anticompounding feature that prevented application of the service and secondaryparking brake at the same time the secondaryparking brakes were applied by pulling out a brake control valve pushing the knob inward released the brakes if the air pressure in the brake system fell below  pounds the secondaryparking brake control automatically moved to the apply out position and applied the brakes this system functioned as designed the scraper was initially inspected while turned on its side and all wheels except the left front wheel were off the ground the right front wheel and both rear wheels could be turned by hand the braking systems air pressure gage read approximately  psi and the secondaryparking brake control was in the apply out position this indicated that although the secondaryparking brakes were applied the brake shoe linings of the wheels were not contacting the drums initial inspection of the brake system found the air lines to both the service and secondaryparking brake sections of the right front brake canister were disconnected a cap had been installed on the air line fitting that connected the parking brake section of the canister another cap had been installed on the outlet of the tractor relay valve to the air line for the service brake section of the right front brake canister the end of the service brake air line had been disconnected from the relay valve and was taped to the relay valve the components were covered with a build up of dirt and grease indicating that the condition had existed before the accident all the air lines to the left front brake chamber were in place when the service brake was applied the canister activated to apply the brake the canisters stroke was measured and found to be  the canister had a maximum stroke of  and the slack adjuster had to be adjusted to  if the stroke was  or more the investigators found the air line to the rear brake air reservoir blocked by locking pliers clamped on the air line between the double check valve and the next check valve the pliers prevented air from being supplied to the rear brake system an audible air leak was heard in the area of the service brake valve but no other air leaks were found when the secondaryparking brake control was moved to the release position only the left front brake canister functioned to release the brake when the service brake pedal was applied only the left front brake canister functioned to apply the service brake the air system was monitored for leaks after the engine was repaired investigators found that with the air system pressurized to  psi and the engine off air leaked out of the system at a rate of approximately  psimin which was attributed to the audible and other small leaks in the system the pliers were removed from the air line to the rear brake air reservoir and air was heard filling the reservoir both rear brake canisters functioned to release and apply the brakes however when the service brake pedal was activated air escaped from a hole in the service brake air line between the scrapers relay valve and the service brake section of the left rear canister at a rate of  psimin hydraulic power steering was provided by two double acting steering cylinders that could articulate the machine to an angle of ï¿½ to either side operational tests for steering wheel free play steering wheel force slip of steering wheel and steering time were performed on the steering system the test results indicated that the steering system did not contribute to the cause of the accident training and experience the victim had two weeks mining experience all at this operation he had received training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following causal factors were identified causal factor policies standards and controls were inadequate and failed to ensure that berms were maintained along the elevated edge of the stockpile corrective action procedures should be established that require berms to be maintained on elevated edges of stockpiles where material is dumped causal factor procedures were not in place to ensure that seat belts were worn when persons operated mobile equipment corrective action procedures should be established that require management to regularly check equipment operators to ensure seat belts are being worn causal factors procedures for performing a preoperational inspection of the machine were not followed and failed to implement corrective actions in a timely manner three of four wheel brakes provided on the machine had been purposely disabled a month prior to the accident corrective action procedures should be established to ensure that preoperational inspections of mobile equipment are conducted the procedures should require self propelled mobile equipment with safety defects to be removed from service until repairs have been made conclusion management policies and controls were inadequate the mine operator failed to ensure

circuit reed was troubleshooting an electrical problem in the motor ladder startup sequence for the no  ball mill electrical motors an airmagnetic circuit breaker that provided over current protection to the circuit failed resulting in a sustained arcflash the accident occurred because management failed to ensure that the airmagnetic circuit breaker provided over current protection for the electrical circuit the failure to also provide circuit overload protection for the plants incoming power feed circuit also contributed to the accident general information united plant an iron ore taconite milling operation owned and operated by united taconite llc was located in eveleth st louis county minnesota the principal operating official was todd d roth vice president and general manager the plant normally operated various shifts hours a day  days a week total employment at the plant was  persons raw iron ore was shipped to the plant by train from another location the material was crushed and milled in a multiple step process iron was separated from the processed taconite ore by magnetic separation and the iron rich concentrate was processed for shipping by adding a binder and rolled to form green pellets the finished heathardened pellets were shipped by train to port loading facilities and sold for use in steel manufacturing the last regular inspection of this operation was completed on september   description of accident the week prior to the accident ball mill no  was experiencing random nuisance trips on october   the day before the accident the concentrator ball mill production lines were taken offline while repairs were being made to the plants taconite tailings disposal system after repairs had been completed the ball mills were started the no  ball mill was started on the night shift ran for approximately  minutes and then shut down automatically attempts to restart the no  ball mill were unsuccessful bryan d sandnas electronic technician was called to troubleshoot the motor startup sequence ladder for the motors used to drive the ball mills the next day sandnas arrived at the plant about  am he tried to diagnose the problem by examining the motor startup sequence ladder about  am andrew d reed maintenance coordinator started his normal work shift he helped sandnas diagnose the electrical problem at approximately  am erik n maki electronic technician arrived to assist reed and sandnas before breaking for lunch reed and sandnas thought they had isolated the problem to the circuit that controlled the motor starter conductors they discussed attempting to start up no  ball mill in test power about  pm the crew returned to the motor control room mcc and prepared to start up the no  ball mill sandnas closed and bolted the no  south and north motor control cabinets and then racked in the motor starter he called the control room to request that the no  ball mill be started the control room operator initiated the startup sequence sandnas and maki were standing apart but along the east side of the motor control center room so they could both watch the relays associated with the startup of no  ball mill sandnas was standing by the dhx relay cabinet adjacent to a door while maki stood in front of the no  dc drive cabinet russell a korpi lube technician passing the motor control room saw reed standing near the west wall by the ball mill motor control starter relay cabinets when the premill startup procedures were completed the startup of the no  mill was initiated by the control room as the mill tried to start sandnas and maki initially heard a loud noise and then saw a large ball of fire coming from the opposite side of the mcc room near reed maki attempted to move toward reed but retreated due to fire and smoke maki and sandnas evacuated the mcc room and sandnas then called on his radio requesting that no  ball mill be shut down plant emergency response personnel and the local fire and emergency medical services were called to the scene emergency responders searched for reed and found him in the mcc room the victim was pronounced dead at the scene by a st louis county medical examiners deputy coroner death was attributed to smoke inhalation investigation of the accident msha was notified of the accident on october   at  pm by a telephone call from kelly r campbell section manager for safety and loss control to george f schorr supervisory special investigator an investigation began the same day an order was issued pursuant to section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners mshas accident investigation team conducted a physical inspection of the accident site interviewed employees and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management employees and the miners representatives discussion location of the accident the accident occurred in the new side motor control center located on the balling mill floor in the concentrator building the airmagnetic circuit breaker overcurrent protective device that failed to clear the fault was located in the new side substation distribution building part of the plants electrical power feed substation electrical equipment electrical power entered the mine site at the main substation by means of two kv feeds and immediately entered two allischalmers oil circuit breakers ocb electrical power was then distributed through a kv bus that fed five kvv transformers transformer no  which was involved in the accident fed the new side substation distribution room sdr v bus  electrical power was further distributed to the plant through allischalmers airmagnetic circuit breakers acb electrical power was provided to the concentrator building new side ball mill motor control center mcc room by approximately  feet of  mcm cables appendix b as a result of the accident the mcc room where the victim was found and the new side sdr were badly damaged the  electrical conductors that ran from the sdr to the mcc room also sustained significant damage during the accident the mcc room sustained damage to the entire west wall incoming bus where the arcing originated due to the extent of damage the origin of the initial fault could not be determined however after the inception of initial fault the fault enveloped all threephases of the electrical power on the lineside of the ball mill motor starter vacuum contactor in the mcc room damage to the line side of the no  south ball mill motors starter was the most extensive the power cables feeding this motor appeared to be burned from the inside out damage to these power cables was evident throughout the entire  feet of cable between the sdr and the mcc room the damage to the wires was indicative to a vast fault current over a period of time internal heating of the cables that supplied power to ball mills no  and no  was evident but not excessive thus supporting no  ball mill line side feed as the origin of the initial fault the electrical circuits that supplied power to ball mills nos   and  were protected by an allischalmers acb this breaker was located in the sdr and was found in the closed on position after the accident electrical power continued to be supplied to the mcc room through the acb and was only interrupted when the cables feeding nos   and  ball mills melted causing a physical break in electrical connection approximately  minutes after the initial fault occurred the ocb tripped interrupting electrical power to the entire plant the ocb was equipped with an undervoltage relay device the device was designed to open when incoming voltage dropped below a certain percentage of the original line voltage usually  to  percent when the incoming kv voltage dropped the undervoltage relay opened and cut power the ocb was equipped with an overcurrent relay however this overcurrent relay was not functional and failed to protect the load side electrical circuit weather conditions weather was not considered a factor in the accident training and experience andrew d reed maintenance coordinator had  year and  months of mining experience all at this operation he had received training in accordance with  cfr part  and had earned a bachelors degree in electrical engineering he was experienced in troubleshooting electrical startup problems bryan d sandnas electronic technician had  years and  months of mining experience all at this operation he was experienced in troubleshooting electrical startup problems erik n maki electronic technician had  years and  months of mining experience all at this operation he was experienced in troubleshooting electrical startup problems root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following root causes were identified root cause management policies and controls were inadequate there were no procedures requiring the circuit breakers to be examined and tested periodically to ensure these overcurrent protective devices functioned properly corrective action management should ensure that all electrical circuits are protected with overcurrent protective devices and that these devices are maintained and tested in accordance with manufacturer recommendations root cause management failed to recognize the potential hazard of not providing overcurrent protective devices on all electrical circuits corrective action management should ensure that all electrical circuits are protected with overcurrent protective devices conclusion the accident occurred because the mine operator failed to ensure that the airmagnetic circuit breaker provided overcurrent protection for the electrical circuit the severity of this accident was impacted by the mine operators failure to also provide circuit overload protection for the plants incoming power feed circuit enforcement actions order no  was issued on october   under provisions of section k of the mine

stated the conveyors stopped and all of the lights went out about  am he attempted to contact hickmott by radio and cell phone but could not reach him solis then traveled to the shoreline and discovered the dredge had capsized greg egan manager of norse trucking located adjacent to the mine arrived for work and noticed the lights off upon entering the mine to investigate the reason egan learned of the accident and called for emergency assistance at  am the oakland county sheriffs office dive team oxford fire department divers and charles tulip commercial technical diver were dispatched to the scene the victim was recovered at  pm and pronounced dead at the scene by an oakland county medical examiner the cause of death was attributed to drowning investigation of the accident msha was notified of the accident at  am on october   by a telephone call from terry o wagaman safety manager to gerald holeman assistant district manager an investigation began the same day an order was issued pursuant to section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of miners mshas accident investigation team conducted a physical inspection of the accident site interviewed employees and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and employees discussion location of the accident the accident occurred at the pit area of this sand and gravel mining operation the pit area was approximately  acres in size the dredge was actively mining in approximately  feet of water at the time of the accident dredge the rohr model rs bf floating clamshell dredge was erected in  at the mine a clamshell bucket was used to extract sand and gravel from the bottom of the lake the bucket was hoisted and transported by a trolley rail system to an onboard hopper where the material was deposited material was then crushed screened and discharged onto a floating product conveyor belt that connected to a landbased conveyor belt system attempts to right the dredge have been unsuccessful and the mine operator has considered scrapping it the following factors were based on witness statements manuals and components examined or viewed as the dredge was repositioned during recovery attempts management had made structural modifications to the dredge a plywood and metal cover was built over the walkway to the operators station access stairs approximately  square feet of ï¿½inch steel plate weighing about  pounds had been placed on the dig end deck to reinforce the area where boulders rested the chute from the grizzly to the crusher an approximate  square foot area was lined with a ï¿½inch thick steel plate weighing approximately  pounds the total added weight in steel deck reinforcement and chute lining was approximately  pounds or  tons the dredge was powered by electricity that was supplied by a  volt insulated feeder cable which was strung along the floating product conveyor the floating conveyor system connected the dredge to the shore the dredge was manufactured with rectangular shaped pontoons that were divided into  separate compartments or cells appendix b picture # during inspection of the capsized dredge cracks were observed in the pontoon which supported the crusher on the conveyor side of the dredge see appendix b picture # and overhead view of dredge prior to the accident unsuccessful attempts had been made to repair cracks from the inside of the pontoon cells five cells were determined to be leaking damaged pontoon cells  one cell on the operators side had a sump pump permanently installed in it a inch hole was cut in the deck to access the cell a stand pipe which stood  inches off the deck was placed in the hole to route the sump pump discharge pipe and electrical cord the cell hatch cover was secured in place the  volt pump was plugged into a receptacle with ground fault circuit interruption gfci protection and controlled by a water level switch the pump reportedly ran a few times a day  two cells were on the discharge end towards the conveyor side and were pumped periodically when water was observed during inspections  two cells were on the conveyor side towards the discharge end one cell was allowed to stay full of water to maintain a level dredge the other cell had to be pumped approximately every half hour with a permanently installed sump pump during dredge operation equipment operators had to periodically inspect the operation of pontoon pumps because the gfci devices would trip and the pumps would stop the dredge was equipped with four draft gauges overloads that acted as dredge level alarm sensors when water levels reached a gauge the clamshell operation would shut down the manufacturer recommended the draft gauges be set to activate when the dredge deck came within  inches of the water surface two of the four draft gauges were recovered and examinedappendix b picture # calculations showed that the draft gauges would not activate until the deck was approximately i inches from the water surface the dredge was equipped with a hopper full level alarm to guard against overloading due to a plugged hopper the sensor when activated would not permit the clamshell to be positioned over the hopper and dump the manufacturer recommended the minimum hopper full alarm sensor to activate when the discharge end of the dredge came within   inches of the water surface investigators determined that this sensor was not functional at the time of the accident based on the twist in the floating conveyor and dredge coupling point the location of the only unbroken dredge anchoring cable and the evaluation by the manufacturers representative and mine personnel investigators determined that the dredge capsized by rotating around the operators side a rotation in this direction caused the heaviest side of the dredge to rise in the air a roll around the operators side of the dredge would have been caused by a sudden shift in weight to the lighter side sand and gravel found on the floating conveyor indicated the dredge was producing at a low rate before capsizing dredge operators indicated this type of production happened when pockets of gravel with little sand were encountered since the first  feet of the floating conveyor was empty investigators determined that the conveyor belt continued to run about  seconds after the dredge stopped discharging product on the shift prior to the accident five or six boulders were positioned on the digging end pontoon standard practice was to store boulders on the dredge because they wouldnt pass through the crusher at this location the boulders ranged in size from about  feet by  feet by  feet to  feet by  feet by  feet based on a standard  pounds per cubic foot sandstone rock these boulders would have placed an additional  to  estimated tons of weight on the digging end pontoon weather conditions weather conditions were clear and calm with a temperature of approximately  degrees fahrenheit weather conditions were not considered a factor in the accident training and experience mark j hickmott had  years mining experience all at this operation and had received training in accordance with  cfr part  he had  years experience operating the dredge root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following root causes were identified root cause management policies and controls were inadequate procedures had not been established to ensure that leaks in the dredge pontoons were repaired sump pumps were installed in four leaking pontoon cells the pumps were plugged into electrical ground fault circuit interrupters gfci which had to be regularly monitored to ensure they were operating corrective action management should establish procedures for repairing the dredge pontoon cells when leaks develop root cause management policies and controls were inadequate procedures had not been established for modifying the original design of the dredge additional steel plating had been added on the front end of the dredge to support the storage of large boulders encountered while mining additional steel plating had also been added to the crusher feed chute corrective action management should establish procedures to ensure that modifications to the original design of the dredge were within the design capacity of the manufacturer root cause management policies and controls were inadequate procedures had not been established to ensure the high dredge overload and full hopper alarm switches were properly positioned and functioning within the specifications set by the manufacturer the switches were set to permit approximately  inches of freeboard the dredge was designed for a minimum  inches of freeboard to prevent overloading the dredge corrective action management should establish procedures for proper examination and maintenance of safety controls provided by the dredge manufacturer to ensure that modifications to the original design of the dredge do not reduce the in process weight safety margin miners should be thoroughly trained in the established procedures conclusion the dredge capsized because it had been modified and used beyond the design capacity intended by the manufacturer the high dredge alarm overload sensors were not maintained at the setting specified by the manufacturer steel plating had been added to the front end of the dredge and to the crusher feed chute large boulders were stored on the deck of the dredge one pontoon cell was allowed to stay filled with water these modifications impacted the stability of the dredge and created a hazard to miners enforcement actions order no  was issued on october   under section k of the mine act a fatal accident occurred at this mining operation on october   when one miner was operating a dredge and it rolled completely upside down at the lake area north of north hummer lake road this order is issued to assure the

operated two hour shifts per day five days a week total employment was  persons limestone was drilled blasted and mined with hydraulic shovels haulage trucks transported the material to the primary crusher in the quarry material was then conveyed to the main plant where it was further crushed screened and washed the finished products were sold for use as construction aggregate the last regular inspection of this operation was completed on june   description of the accident on the day of the accident samuel m kemp victim reported for work at  am his normal starting time about  am the cone crusher plugged and stopped burning off the drive belts kemp eric j randle quality control technician and bryon l nipple plant crusher operator installed new drive belts kemp jon e riley plant crusher operator and forrest e eiler primary plant operator cleaned out the crusher and found a steel tooth from a frontend loader bucket lodged in it kemp and riley placed a ton jack on the outside of the crusher framework and tried to extend the reach of the jack by placing a  inch diameter by inch long steel tail pulley shaft and several pieces of steel plate on top of the jack they unsuccessfully attempted to raise the crushers upper section to dislodge the tooth kemp and riley then put a ton jack near the ton jack and extended the reach by placing a  inch diameter by  inch long round steel tail pulley shaft on top of the jack they placed a chain in front of the steel shafts in an attempt to prevent movement the upper section would not raise using the two jacks kemp and riley were able to raise the upper section after placing a ton jack by the ton jack and a ton jack next to the ton jack the tooth still remained lodged in the crusher so kemp instructed nipple to use a torch to cut it out about  pm the tooth was removed and eiler released the ton jack adjacent to the ton jack kemp was about to release the other ton jack when the remaining jacks suddenly kicked out kemp was struck by material placed on top of the jacks coworkers immediately attended to kemp emergency medical personnel arrived and transported the victim to a hospital where he died on october   the cause of death was attributed to traumatic injury investigation of the accident the mine safety and health administration msha was notified of the accident on october   by a telephone call from larry harshbarger corporate safety director to mshas national call center gerald d holeman assistant district manager was called and an investigation began the same day mshas investigation team traveled to the mine conducted a physical inspection of the accident site interviewed mine employees and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management employees and the miners representative discussion location of the accident the accident occurred at the crushing and screening plant the ground around the plant was fairly level and dry crusher the ï¿½footdiameter cone crusher was manufactured by nordberg symons the crushers stationary housing consisted of two main sections a lower main frame and an upper bowl held together by bolts and compression springs the compression springs provided a degree of upward freedom when material became lodged in the crusher the springs would compress and permit the object to pass through the opening an eccentric rotating conical head was positioned inside the crusher with the larger diameter at the bottom this head provided crushing action to the stationary bowl large rocks fed into the top of the crusher and fell through the bottom after they were crushed jacks four portable hydraulic bottle jacks two ton one ton and one ton capacity jacks were used to raise the crushers upper section the jacks were designed to provide a large linear force in a small portable package a handle attached to a small internal ram was used to force hydraulic fluid into the larger lifting ram the jacks were actuated by applying strokes to the small ram that moved the larger lifting ram a short distance the rams on the bottle jacks were solid and did not have height adjustments no defects were found on the jacks jack positioning material was placed above and under the jacks to extend their reach because they had short ram heights a ton jack was resting on a wooden block with the ram pressing against the crushers lower spring segment a ton jack was positioned to rest on the main crusher frame with a round steel tail pulley shaft on top of the ram pressing against a lug on the upper section of the crusher a ton jack was resting on the main frame with a stack of various steel plates on the jacks ram a round steel tail pulley shaft was positioned on top of the plates to press against a lug on the crushers upper section another ton jack was resting on a steel hbeam with the ram pressing against the crushers lower spring segment a ï¿½inch steel chain had been placed in front of the round steel tail pulley shafts to prevent movement weather conditions on the day of the accident weather conditions were clear and dry with a temperature of about  degrees fahrenheit weather was not considered to be a factor in the accident training and experience samuel m kemp had  years  weeks and  days experience all at this operation he had been assistant superintendent for  years  weeks and  days and had received training in accordance with  cfr part  his experience included jacking up the crushers upper section about six times to remove objects eric j randle had  years  months experience all at this operation and had received training in accordance with  cfr part  his experience included jacking up the crushers upper section five or six times to remove objects bryon l nipple had  years  month experience all at this operation and had received training in accordance with  cfr part  his experience included jacking up the crushers upper section three times to remove objects forrest e eiler had  years  months experience all at this operation and had received training in accordance with  cfr part  his experience included jacking up the crushers upper section two times to remove objects jon e riley had  years experience all at this operation and had received training in accordance with  cfr part  he had no prior experience jacking up the crushers upper section prior to the day of the accident root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following causal factors were identified causal factor management policies procedures and controls were inadequate management had not developed safe work procedures to remove objects lodged in the crusher the crew working to free the blocked crusher used jacks to raise the upper section of the crusher while it was under pressure from the compression springs corrective action management should develop and implement procedures to ensure that persons can safely remove objects lodged in the crusher the manufacturers procedures should be followed to clear a blocked crusher analyze and manage each task to evaluate possible hazards and ensure steps are taken to safely perform the task causal factor management did not have a system in place to prevent metal from entering the crusher corrective action management should install a system to detect and prevent metal from entering the crusher conclusion the accident occurred because management procedures and controls were inadequate and failed to ensure that persons could safely remove objects lodged in the crusher the manufacturers procedures for removing objects blocking the crusher were not followed enforcement actions the jacks were not designed to be used in conjunction with steel plates and shafts as extensions the following citation was issued citation no  was issued on january   under the provisions of section a of the mine act for a violation of  cfr  a fatal accident occurred at this mine on october   when a miner was struck by material placed on top of portable hydraulic bottle jacks the victim and coworkers placed steel tail pulley shafts and steel plating on top of the jacks to extend the reach of the lifting cylinders on the jacks this jacking system was pressurized to compress the springs on a cone crusher and raise the crushers upper section in an effort to free a metal bucket tooth wedged in the crusher this citation was terminated on february   after the mine operator installed an electrically operated hydraulic system to raise the crushers upper section to remove tramp steel blocking

location of the accident the accident occurred in the middle entry of the  longwall panel number  between crosscuts  and  the entry was driven using a borer mining machine and was about  feet wide and  feet high the roof and floor were cut flat with the radial cutter heads but the borer created convex curved ribs on both sides of the entry two high pressure emulsion pipes were attached to the roof on one side of the entry threephase grounded power cables along with other cables were attached to the roof on the opposite side scuff marks were noted on the power cable the right front tire of the service truck contacted the right rib of the entry the same tire created a mark on the roof approximately  feet from initial contact with the rib the angle of climb on the rib measured  there was no indication that the truck slid forward once it landed upside down indicating a slower speedweight ratio as the vehicle rolled it rotated counter clockwise with the passenger side coming to rest across the entry to the left north rib service truck the vehicle involved in the accident was a sien equipment company model brute  mantrip powered by a  cylinder diesel engine originally a  passenger mantrip the vehicle was used as a combination mechanics transport and service truck approximately  pounds of tools and supplies were being transported the total load capacity of the truck was about  pounds the manufacturer was no longer in business the braking systems were inspected and tested the service brake was a foot pedal operated hydraulic applied system with disc brakes on the front axle and drum brakes on the rear axle the brakes on both the front and rear axles were activated by a foot activated master cylinder the service brake system did not have a power assist no grease or oil was found on the brake components on either the front or rear axle of the vehicle after the truck was turned over and placed on its wheels the master cylinder reservoir was still full of brake fluid a service brake test was conducted and the service brake held the vehicle in place through the entire range of forward and reverse gears the parkemergency brake was a footoperated cable type brake system that applied the drum brake on the rear axle when tested it did not function the rear wheels could be turned by hand when the parkemergency brake was fully applied the brake cables were stuck and could not be pulled a noncontributory citation was issued for this violation the hydraulic steering system consisted of a gear driven power steering pump an orbitrol power steering valve and a hydraulic steering cylinder flow from the power steering pump was directed to the power steering valve when the engine was operating movement of the steering wheel would cause the power steering valve to direct flow from the power steering pump to the hydraulic steering cylinder allowing the front wheels to turn a new pin was installed in the steering cylinder clevis to replace the missing pin a test of the steering system showed that it was functional the steering cylinder on the vehicle was a spencer model xalsal the cylinder had a inch bore and an inch stroke the cylinder rod was  inches in diameter and the distance between the centers of the cylinder mounting pins was ï¿½ inches when the cylinder was retracted and ï¿½ inches with the cylinder extended the nominal diameter of the cylinder mounting clevis pin hole was inch diameter on both the rod and cylinder sides of the steering cylinder the steering cylinder had a maximum working pressure of  pounds per square inch psi when tested the maximum steering system operating pressure was  psi figure  appendix b shows a photo of the steering cylinder clevis pin that came out of the steering cylinder clevis at the time of the accident one end of this pin still had the hairpin fastener clip in place the nominal diameter of the pin was inch and the length was approximately  inches this pin had a groove at each end that was approximately  inch wide and approximately  inch deep a hole with a diameter of approximately  inch was drilled through the pin at the location of each groove a hairpin fastener was placed in the groove on each end of the clevis pin to secure it in the clevis this pin top pin is depicted in figure  appendix b a pin similar to the pin that came out of the steering cylinder clevis at the time of the accident and two new hairpin clips are shown in the bottom of the photo in figure  appendix b figure  appendix b depicts the cylinder on the machine at the time of the accident this drawing shows hairpin clips holding the clevis pins in place the outside diameter of the steering cylinder clevis pin that fell out at the time of the accident was compared with the inside diameter of the clevis pin hole on the rod end of the steering cylinder the wear on these parts allowed the cylinder clevis pin to move while the vehicle traveled this movement allowed the clevis pin to slide out when the hairpin fastener installed on one end of the pin came off the suspension system was inspected and no defects were found training and experience carder a largent jr had  years  months experience and had received training in accordance with  cfr part  daniel hellickson had  years  months experience and had received training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following causal factor was identified causal factor the mine operator and the equipment manufacturer failed to identify the possible hazard of using this type of fastener clip to secure the steering cylinder clevis pin in place no compensation was made for the normal wear caused by the movement of the clevis pin corrective action procedures should be implemented to utilize a different type of fastener to secure the steering cylinder clevis pin conclusion management failed to identify the hazard that normal wear would have on the fastener clips that secured the steering cylinder clevis pin the steering cylinder disengaged from the tie rod causing the truck to veer right and subsequently rollover one of the two hairpin type retaining clips used to secure the steering cylinder clevis pin was not in place causing the pin to fall out the mine operator replaced the steering pins with a  inch diameter grade  bolt trimmed to  inches in length a  inch diameter hole was

jacobson mine safety and health inspector an investigation was started the same day an order was issued pursuant to section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners mshas accident investigation team traveled to the mine conducted a physical inspection of the accident site interviewed employees and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management employees and emergency personnel discussion location of the accident the accident occurred at the nordberg jaw crusher that was being prepared for use as the primary crusher the weather was sunny with a temperature of about  degrees fahrenheit jaw crusher the nordberg vb model  jaw crusher was purchased new for this property in  the crusher was powered by a volt  horsepower electric motor that operated at  revolutions per minute the crusher was mounted on a steel beam tower with a scalping screen above the crusher feed hopper the dimensions of the feed opening of the crusher were  inches by  inches the crusher jaws were set in an openbottomed v one jaw fixed to the frame while the movable jaw was pivoted to swing from its top edge under power the movable jaw was driven toward the fixed jaw to impose a crushing force the movable jaw then moved back to allow the material to drop further into or through the gap both fixed and movable jaws consisted of one jaw plate made of manganese steel the movable jaw bolted to the pitman and was equipped with an upper pitman cover plate the movable jaw weighed  pounds and the pitman weighed  pounds totaling  pounds pitman cylinder pump the crusher was equipped with an electric pump and hydraulic jack mounted to the frame the manufacturer had installed this unit to push the pitman forward so that safety pins could be installed in the holes provided to block the pitman from movement toggle plate and toggle plate seats the toggle plate was the pivot point for the pitman and in conjunction with the eccentric shaft generated the crushing motion of the movable jaw against the stationary jaw the toggle plate had beveled or rounded ends and rested between the pitman toggle seat and the adjustable toggle seat which were grooved to receive the toggle plate the pitman toggle seat measured  inches by  inches by  inches it had been previously modified by cutting about  inches from the right end the pitman toggle seat was designed to be secured to the rear of the pitman by four toggle seat wedges however on the day of the accident only two wedges secured the pitman toggle seat to the pitman the other two wedges were missing and the bolts appeared to have been sheared off during operation of the crusher examination of the pitman toggle seat revealed that the left side drive side was striking and eroding the left side of the crusher structure resulting in an approximate inch gouge in the steel side wall there was an identical gouge on the right side of the structure both right side and left side markings on the steel plating matched the shape of the ends of the pitman toggle seat eccentric shaft pitman and flywheel the eccentric lobed shaft provided motion to the pitman and movable side jaw it had four positions depending on the direction that the lobe was facing up down forward and back the pitman extended down from the eccentric shaft to the bottom of the crusher frame the pitmans center of gravity caused it to rest on the stops provided to close the gap left by the removed toggle seat the position of the lobed shaft and flywheel did not change the center of gravity of the pitman maintenance procedures and other factors the victim accessed the work area via scaffolding that was spot welded between two ibeams within the crusher framework the scaffolding walkway was  feet long and  feet wide the scaffolding deck was  inches above the concrete slab and approximately  inches to the pitman toggle seat when the crusher had to be accessed for maintenance the workers connected the pitman cylinder hydraulic ram to the mounting bracket on the rear of the pitman they would then extend the pitman cylinder with the hydraulic pump this action freed the toggle plate and provided access to the pitman toggle seat the pitman could be safely blocked from movement in this position by inserting pitman hold pins into the two holes on either side of the crusher during the accident investigation two pitman hold pins were found on the mine site during the time of the accident the lack of electrical power to the crusher prevented the workers from using the pitman cylinder to close the pitman instead the victim and coworker moved the pitman on the day prior to the accident with a ton capacity hydraulic portopower hand pump this enabled them to remove the toggle plate the portopower hand pump was also removed and the flywheel was turned one revolution by hand reportedly the workers assumed that by turning the flywheel the pitman would swing to its resting position and contain zero potential energy at the time of the accident however the pitman toggle seat was protruding approximately  inches outside its normal position and was caught in the edge of the left side gouge this prevented the pitman from swinging to its typical resting position once the victim removed the toggle seat wedges the pitman toggle seat was no longer secured to the pitman allowing the pitman toggle seat to slide laterally to the right removing the edge from the left side gouge when the pitman toggle seat slid nothing prevented the pitman from swinging back to its resting position and striking the victim there was approximately  inches of accessible work space when the pitman was supported properly by the two safety pins without the safety pins installed the pitman rested against stops in this position there was about  inches to  inches of space between the pitman and the crusher structure using these measurements investigators estimated that the pitman swung approximately  to  inches during the accident nordbergs jaw crusher instruction manual provided a fourteen step procedure for removal of the toggle plate and toggle plate seats step eight described the insertion of a safety pin through the side frame of the crusher to prevent the pitman from moving back against the stops two copies of this manual were available at the mine training and experience eric bennett had a total of five years of mining experience eleven months at this mine he had received training in accordance with  cfr part  bennett did not have any prior experience nor had he received any training to safely perform this task richard berkshire had performed this same task in  however he had not received any training specific to this task the manufacturers instruction manual was not provided to the crusher repair crew root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following causal factors were identified causal factor management policies standards and controls were inadequate procedures were not in place to ensure that the pitman was blocked against hazardous motion before the toggle seat wedge bolts were removed corrective action management should develop and implement procedures that ensure repairs to the jaw crusher do not expose miners to hazards perform a thorough risk assessment before starting a task to ensure that all hazards are controlled or eliminated these procedures should include the manufacturers recommendations regarding the insertion of a safety pin through the side frame of the crusher to prevent movement of the pitman causal factor standards and controls were inadequate no task training was provided to the miners regarding the removal of the toggle seat on the jaw crusher to make them aware of the health and safety aspects of the task corrective action management should task train miners before assigning them tasks in which they have no previous work experience this training should include procedures and safety devices recommended by the manufacturer conclusion the accident occurred because the pitman was not blocked against hazardous motion before the toggle seat wedge bolts were removed no procedures were in place to ensure that the task could be completed safely task training had not been conducted violations order no  was issued on june   under the provisions of section k of the mine

accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management mine employees and the local sheriffs office discussion location of the accident the accident occurred on the bridge that crossed the chapman arm of the willamette river this bridge provided access to the pit and was constructed in  the mining company owned and maintained the bridge the bridge was approximately  feet above the water the bridge deck was approximately  feet long  feet  inches wide and was located about  feet from the pit and about  mile from the plant public highway type guard rails were installed on each side of the bridge and six foot chain link fencing was attached to the outside of the guard rail posts the width between the vertical guard support beams was approximately  ï¿½ feet the height of the rail structures was approximately  inches and the top of the guard rails were approximately  inches above the deck of the bridge all four ends of the guard rail ended with the bridge structure equipment the haul truck involved in the accident was a  caterpillar model c that had a rigid frame equipped with a dump body and a tailgate the engine was a caterpillar model  diesel coupled to a caterpillar automatic transmission with seven forward speeds and one reverse speed the machine had a rollover protective structure rops which did not visually appear to sustain any permanent deflection and did not compromise the operators work station the rops certification tag indicated that the structure was certified for use on the model c and that the rops met sae j the truck weighed approximately  pounds and had a maximum gross vehicle weight of approximately  pounds reportedly the truck was loaded with four buckets of raw material estimated weight  pounds from two caterpillar  front end loaders the supplemental and main steering systems were inspected tested and determined to be functional the truck was equipped with a dual circuit air over hydraulic service brake system one circuit for the steering axle service brakes and one circuit for the drive axle service brakes caliper disc brakes were used on the steering axle front brakes and enclosed wet disc type brakes on the drive axle rear brakes visual inspection and testing of the braking systems the steering systems and the governor control system did not identify any defects that would have affected the ability of the driver to control the truck prior to the impact with the guard rail the truck had  r  xdt et tubeless tires on all six wheels the midaxle height of the truck was approximately  ï¿½ inches above the ground the right front tire was flat while the other five tires were inflated a visual inspection of the right front tire indicated that a section of the tire liner approximately  inches long and  inches wide had been damaged a piece of the tire was found in the area of the initial impact with the guard rail abutment which was consistent with the damage to the tire liner this indicated that the right front tire experienced an abrupt loss of air during the initial impact and would have adversely affected the ability of the driver to steer the truck seat belt after the accident the victim was in the cab of the truck with his seatbelt buckled investigators found the seat belt still buckled with the webbing cut approximately  inches from the loop of the male end attachment the seat belt was cut to extricate the victim weather on the day of the accident the weather was sunny with clear skies and a temperature of approximately  degrees fahrenheit the weather was not a factor in the accident training and experience mark slinker had  years mining experience all at this mine he had operated heavy mobile equipment for  years and had received training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was performed and the following root cause was identified root cause management policies and procedures were inadequate and failed to ensure that drivers maintained control of mobile equipment the trucks tire struck the guard rail and lost air causing the truck to leave the bridge corrective action management should implement policies and procedures to ensure truck drivers operate mobile equipment safely on the bridge without striking the guard rail guard rails should be constructed to aid a truck driver in maintaining control if the truck strikes a guard rail conclusion the accident occurred because the truck driver did not maintain control of the truck as he drove across the bridge the right front tire struck the guard rail causing the tire to lose air and adversely affected the truck drivers ability to steer the truck the

employees and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management employees and the ohio division of mineral resources management discussion location of the accident the accident occurred at the east edge of the bulk bag warehouse roof located at the northeast corner of the bag plant the single pitch roof of the bulk bag warehouse was  feet long  feet wide and  feet above the ground the roof sloped slightly from west to east about  inch every  feet access to the roof was provided by steps from the bulk bag warehouse the north and south sides of the roof had small parapet walls ranging in height from  inches at the west end to  inches at the east end the roof was bordered along the east side by a  inch water control lip and a drain the roofs surface structure was composed of a series of rolled shingles covered with tar a light dusting of sand over the tar surface gave the roof a gritty texture except in the areas with standing water a slight depression in the roof surface created a puddle of standing water near the east edge of the roof in the general area from which the victim fell the puddle measured  inches by  inches and varied from  to  inches deep the configuration of the roof prevented the puddle from draining into a drain hole approximately  inches away from the roofs edge the action of the wind caused accumulations of sand approximately  inches deep along the edges of the roof the sand had also accumulated over time from exhaust ventilation and spillage from a conveyor belt that passed along the west end of the roof the conveyor exited the bag plant from the rotary dryer area and transported product to bins located north of the bag house facility sand accumulations in the general area of the conveyor were reportedly up to  inches deep there were no handrails along the unprotected edges of the roof no anchorage points were available on the roof for affixing a safety belt and line however safety belts and lines were provided near the bins and at the maintenance shop weather the weather was not considered to be a factor of the accident it was overcast with a temperature of approximately  degrees fahrenheit a light rain had fallen earlier that morning cleaning method tools and equipment accumulations of material were cleaned up every two to three years to prevent excessive loading previously sand was cleaned from the edges of the roof with a high pressure water hose the victim had been using a shovel with a  foot handle and a  inch flat blade shovel marks in the remaining sand indicated that the victim shoveled parallel to the roofs east edge training and experience timothy j nevison had ten weeks and four days total mining experience all at this operation he had received training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following causal factor was identified causal factor safe work procedures were inadequate personnel assigned to shovel accumulations of material along the edge of the roof were not briefed regarding the use of fall protection when the task was assigned the victim shoveled parallel to the edge of the roof without wearing a safety belt secured to a line no anchorage points to secure a line had been installed corrective action conduct a risk analysis before starting work to identify hazards and implement measures to ensure persons are properly protected monitor tasks to reinforce safe procedures and ensure that employees wear fall protection where there is a danger of falling determine if the task could be performed a safe distance from the edge of the roof using other methods such as high pressure water conclusion the accident occurred because safe

the flat area the total capacity of each trailer was  cubic feet truck rack the truck rack was a model rtc a fabricated by graff access equipment in  the access walkway was  inches long and  inches wide the hand rail basket measured  inches wide  inches long and  inches high the access walkway and its attached handrail basket could be moved to a fixed position the access walkway pivoted at the connection points to the main structure this allowed the access walkway to move as needed to contact bulk trailers of various heights as the access walkway pivoted the handrail basket also pivoted and remained perpendicular to the ground when properly tensioned as recommended by the manufacturer the handrail basket maintained a constant distance from the trailer top relative to the angle of the access walkway the access walkway was spring tensioned which aided the truck drivers to bring it and the handrail basket to the upright fixed position when not in use however the access walkway involved in the accident was not properly tensioned the tension was too tight causing the access walkway to rise when the victim stepped off it and onto the truck the spring tension was not checked on a regular basis as recommended by the manufacturer training and experience salvador torres had  years experience as an over the road truck driver he was an independent contractor leasing a trailer

mine management employees miners representative and personnel from the pennsylvania department of environmental protection discussion location of the accident the accident occurred on the south side of the main shop weather on the day of the accident the weather was cloudy and cool with intermittent rain frontend loader the frontend loader involved in the accident was a  caterpillar model g ii wheel loader with an articulating frame it was powered by a caterpillar turbocharged sixcylinder model  diesel engine the loaders operating weight was approximately  pounds and it was equipped with a  cubic yard bucket sae nominal heaped capacity the electronically controlled transmission had four forward and four reverse speeds and a neutral position braking systems the frontend loader was equipped with hydraulic wet disc service brakes in the front and rear axles the heat from braking friction was removed by oil in the axle housing the service brake could be applied using foot pedals located on either side of the steering column in addition to applying the brake the left side pedal neutralized the transmission the equipment operator could disable this feature by depressing the transmission neutralizer override switch after the engine had started when operating in the disabled mode the left side pedal still activated the service brakes the service brake stopped and held the fully loaded machine in both directions of travel on a  percent grade when either of the two brake pedals was depressed the parking brake consisted of a spring applied hydraulically released driveline drum brake according to the manufacturers service manual the parking brake release pressure and the service brake application pressure were supplied by a common pump and accumulator hydraulic circuit that had a normal operating pressure of    psi the parking brake could be engaged by pulling the parking brake control knob located on the machine dashboard in addition the parking brake would automatically apply if the pressure in the serviceparking brake hydraulic system dropped below    psi the parking brake held the loader while facing upgrade on a  percent grade but not when facing downgrade as the loader slowly inched forward through the applied parking brake this defect did not contribute to the accident and a noncontributory citation was issued steering the steering wheel was mechanically linked to a steering valve the steering valve controlled the hydraulic oil flow to the steering cylinders no steering defects were found other safety features the operators compartment windows were intact and clean the windshield wipers provided on the front and rear windows functioned four convex rearview mirrors were intact and clean the headlights horn and backup alarm functioned the throttle pedal moved freely and no defects were found the two ends of the seat belt latched and unlatched when tested visibility from the operators seat according to the manufacturers service manual the bucket or other attachments should be raised  inches above the ground when the frontend loader was traveling to provide operator visibility and machine stability since the frontend loader was traveling with its bucket approximately two to four feet off the ground at the time of the accident a simulated test was conducted to determine the blind areas for the equipment operator at these raised bucket positions in this test the blind area was defined as the area that a six foot tall person standing on the ground a measured distance from the machine was not visible to the loader operator during the test an observer who was approximately the same height as the loader operator sat in the operators seat the bucket contained a load similar to the one at the time of the accident the attached photo and figure appendix b illustrate the view from the operators compartment and the resultant blind areas the loader operator experienced the blind area in front of the loader extended out to  feet  feet and  feet when the bottom of the bucket was two feet three feet and four feet above the ground respectively training and experience larry p yoder had  years experience with the companys asphalt paving division and  years of mining experience at this mine he had not received sitespecific hazard awareness training in accordance with  cfr part  a noncontributory citation was issued root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following root causes were identified root cause a risk assessment to determine all possible hazards and to establish safe work procedures was not conducted prior to paving near the mine shop the area was congested with moving mine equipment asphalt equipment and paving personnel corrective actions procedures should be established that require a risk assessment be conducted to identify and correct potential hazards associated with the task to be performed safe traffic control procedures should be developed and

davis district manager an investigation was started that same evening an order was issued under the provisions of section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners mshas accident investigators traveled to the mine made a physical inspection of the accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management miners representatives and employees discussion tractor the tractor involved in the accident was a twowheel drive  ford model number  the tractor equipped with a  cylinder  hp diesel engine and a manual speed transmission had a net weight of  pounds the tractor wheelbase axle to axle centers was approximately  inches a personnel carrier body had been installed on the rear of the tractor to haul personnel tools andor supplies as needed according to mine personnel a local shop fabricated the personnel carrier body the machine as evaluated was not equipped with a roll over protective structure rops mshas mandatory safety and health regulations do not require rops and seat belts to be installed on agriculture tractors that are operated underground the investigators concluded that the tractors engine was still running after the accident repairs to the cooling and exhaust systems were made so the tractor could be evaluated the tractor was operated to conduct functional tests on the brake steering clutch and throttle systems drive lights the right and left side drive lights on the front of the machine were tested and both of them illuminated when the dash mounted flip switch was cycled these lights were reportedly turned off after the accident by mine personnel an additional light described as an area light by mine personnel could be rotated for positioning and was mounted on the right side of the tractor body near the operators seat this light was also determined to be functional using a separate flip switch on the light body throttle control and maximum travel speed the throttle control was a hand lever located on the right side of the dash board panel below the steering wheel the control was arranged so the engine speed increased as the control lever was pulled back toward the operator the throttle control lever was originally designed so the control lever would stay in the position that the operator put it in once hand pressure was released however this was not experienced during functional tests when tested the control lever sprang back to a low idle position depending on how the control lever was modulated if the lever was pulled all the way back and then suddenly released it would spring back to a low idle position however if the control lever was feathered to a partial throttle position it would stay in a partial throttle position when the throttle position was set to a maximum position in which a hands free condition was achievable the engine speed was estimated to be approximately  rpm or approximately ï¿½ throttle the speed of the tractor in th gear and at an engine speed of  rpm was calculated to be approximately  mph at  mph it was estimated that the engine would need to produce approximately  horsepower to maintain this speed on the  grade a review of the engines performance characteristics indicated that the engine should have been capable of producing this horsepower at an engine speed of  rpm this information indicated that the tractor was capable of pulling the grade in the accident area at a speed of approximately  mph without the operator having to adjust the throttle control if the throttle was originally positioned as described above product literature lists a travel speed of  mph in th gear with a maximum engine speed of  rpm steering system the tractor had powerassisted steering with the engine running and could also be operated in the manual mode with the engine off as needed once the tractor was upright the fluid level in the power steering reservoir was determined to be full in both the manual and powerassisted modes of operation the steering wheel was observed to move approximately ï¿½ of a turn or  degrees in order to initiate movement of the wheels when changing steering directions visual observations of the steering linkage and connections did not identify any significant wear in the external linkage connections that might produce this effect the majority of this play in the steering was due to internal problems with the steering gear assembly for comparison purposes the commercial vehicle safety alliance outofservice criterion for onhighway trucks indicated that any movement exceeding  degrees for vehicles equipped with power steering systems would place the vehicle outofservice the steering angles of the right side steering tire were observed to be askew physical damage to the right side of the steering axle was observed investigators determined that the side of this tire skidded across the mine bottom while the rest of the tractor rotated about the right front wheel as it flipped over during the accident service brake system the tractor had left and right side enclosed wet disc brakes on the rear axle the pedals were arranged so that the left and right side brakes were controlled separately by the operators right foot through mechanical linkages the brakes could be applied independently of each other or at the same time by either applying both pedals simultaneously or by locking the pedals together using a pin on the pedal assemblies the pedals were not pinned together when inspected after the accident pull through tests were conducted on the service brakes both the right and left side brakes were functional and returned to the released position after the foot pedals were released the tractor was able to pull through in the th gear ï¿½ throttle with both service brakes applied the service brakes stalled the tractor in both the th and th gears at ï¿½ throttle transmission the tractor had a manual transmission with  forward speeds and  reverse speeds the transmission controls were found in the th gear position tire information and pressures the front tires were firestone champion guide grip  rib f tube type tires size  with a ply rating the rear tires were firestone all traction utility r tube type tires size  with an ply rating the tire pressures cold were measured and are shown in table # left side psi right side psi front axle   rear axle   table # measured cold tire pressures the tire pressures measured for the rear tires were low because the tractor was used for transportation rather than pulling implements which required traction lowering the rear tire pressures was generally used to increase traction andor lower ground pressures however lowering the rear tire pressures combined with a significant differential between the steering tire pressures adversely affected the handling of the tractor in a turning maneuver inflation charts obtained from the manufacturer indicated that the lowest recommended tire pressure for the rear bias ply tires while used in transport and traction services are  psi and  psi respectively these charts indicated that the lowest recommended tire pressure for the front bias ply tires while used in field service should be  psi  firestone tire data book httpwwwfirestoneagcomdatabook february  haulage way information the haulage way immediately before the sturn required that the victim drive downgrade through a dip and then upgrade into the sturn the profile of the haulage way leading up to the accident area in the direction of travel was provided by mine personnel and is summarized in table # general road geometry average downgrade  average upgrade  straight  straight   straight  right turn with a  feet turn radius  right turn with a  feet turn radius  table # profile of haulage way leading up to the accident area in the direction of travel the haulage way was dry and in good condition training and experiance wilson had  years and  weeks of experience as a mechanic and his total mining experience was  years  weeks all at this mine he had received training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following causal factors were identified causal factor management policies standards and controls were deficient and did not ensure that the agriculture tractor was operated safely in the underground environment the tractor was operated at speeds that were not consistent with conditions of roadway grades clearance visibility and the type of equipment corrective action establish policies that govern gear selection and operation speed for all mobile equipment and monitor equipment operation causal factor management policies standards and controls were inadequate and failed to implement corrective actions in a timely manner multiple defects were found on the tractor including the steering system defective throttle detent low tire air pressures and imbalanced air pressures across tire sets the equipment manufacturers guidelines were not utilized to evaluate the need for maintenance or repairs corrective action procedures should be established to ensure that all mobile equipment is inspected for defects prior to being placed into service during each shift mobile equipment operators should be trained to identify safety defects procedures should be implemented to repair any defects that affect safety or remove the equipment from service until the repairs are made equipment manufacturer reference manuals should be available and utilized to develop preshift inspection procedures to identify defects affecting safety causal factor managements task training failed to utilize the equipment manufacturers operation procedures for operating the tractor corrective action establish and implement a training program ensuring that all miners assigned to operate mobile equipment are task trained utilizing the manufacturers operations manuals conclusion the accident occurred because policies standards and controls were inadequate and failed to ensure that the defective throttle control steering assembly and improper tire pressure had been promptly corrected on the tractor the roadway grade and s turn in conjunction with the speed contributed to the operators failure to maintain control of the tractor violations order

regular inspection of this operation was completed on june   description of accident on the day of the accident william c jobin victim arrived for work at approximately  am his normal starting time jobin checked and started the dozer he would operate at  am he went to the shop for a tool box safety and planning meeting conducted by charles p robbins superintendent after the meeting jobin maneuvered the dozer up the access ramp to the first bench about  am donald lucas frontend loader operator entered the quarry and got a bucket of rock to feed the crushing plant he noticed the dozer traveling backwards on the quarry floor just below the first highwall bench lucas did not notice anything wrong with the dozer he went to the crusher and dumped rock into the feeder when lucas returned to the area to get more rock he saw that the dozer was trying to travel backwards up a slope of loose rock lucas attempted to contact jobin by radio but got no response when lucas got closer to the dozer he noticed broken glass and other debris on the quarry floor so he radioed for emergency medical assistance lucas went to the dozer and found jobin nonresponsive in the cab three other

cleaning was located  feet above the quarry floor from the north end of the quarry the bench was  feet wide for a distance of  feet the bench turned right turn to the west narrowing to  feet for a distance of  feet where it tapered to the edge the dozer entered the bench moved forward turned around on the wide section of the bench and traveled around the corner in reverse the dozer was parallel to the edge of the bench on the left side and the highwall on the right side near the end of the bench where it tapered to the edge the right front corner of the dozer made minimal contact with the highwall in two spots two slight directional changes made by the operator put the dozer at an angle to the edge rather than parallel to it since the dozer was traveling in reverse and at an angle most of the ripper was sticking over the edge of the bench the dozer traveled a few more feet before it went over the edge the weather was cloudy with intermittent rain and a temperature of approximately  degrees fahrenheit the visibility was checked at the same time as the accident revealing that natural light provided sufficient visibility equipment the  caterpillar model dr track dozer was equipped with a ublade on the front and a singleshank ripper on the rear it was powered by a six cylinder caterpillar model  diesel engine rated at  horsepower the dozer had a fully enclosed falling object protection systems fops cab with an external rollover protection system rops and weighed approximately  pounds the track width of the dozer was  feet  inches with an overall length of  feet  inches examination and testing of the transmission power train steering and braking systems showed there were no defects involving these systems the seat belt showed no sign of visible damage and latched and unlatched when tested the cabs fops was dented indicating the dozer had rolled over at least once and the rops had several scratches but no visible structural damage training william c jobin had

of a yard locomotive and criswell was in the left rear of the locomotive watching that side of the tracks for shelton ncnew was in a pickup truck at the main line when miller and dedmon drove away in separate pickup trucks miller and dedmon drove ahead to guard crossings and throw switches as the locomotive moved from the main line back to the rail yard to get more loaded rail cars after the locomotive passed miller and dedmon they drove toward the rail yard miller was just behind dedmon who stopped at the north side of the rail yard to throw the last switch miller passed dedmon drove along the west side of the rail yard caught the locomotive then sped up and passed it after getting several hundred feet ahead of the locomotive and midway through the rail yard miller stopped his pickup truck got out and started walking across the rail yard about  pm he walked across two sets of tracks and onto the spur line miller apparently intended to disconnect  loaded rail cars located on the fourth set of tracks east of his pickup truck dedmon also intended to disconnect the loaded rail cars but had driven down the east side of the rail yard so he would not have to cross the spur line on which the locomotive was traveling while miller was crossing the rail yard mcnew radioed the crew and instructed them to disconnect only seven cars because it was raining miller evidently heard the call and turned down the spur line facing away from the locomotive he needed to walk about  feet down the spur line and over to the next set of tracks east of the spur line to disconnect the  loaded rail cars the curve of the tracks and the protruding front section of the locomotive caused shelton to lose sight of miller when he was about  feet in front of the locomotive and  feet west of the

office mine safety and health administration southeast district  gemini circle suite  birmingham al  michael a davis district manager overview clint bloomfield laborer age  was fatally injured on march   when he entered an enclosed dust bin and was engulfed by sliding material the victim was attempting to dislodge material that had adhered to the walls of the bin when the material suddenly broke free the accident occurred because management failed to establish safe work procedures and methods for cleaning the bins the victim had not been task trained in the health and safety aspects and safe work procedures relating to the task being performed it was a practice at this mine for employees to enter bins without being equipped with a safety belt or harness with a lifeline attached a second person similarly equipped was not present to adjust or keep the victims lifeline tight general information grassy stone llc a crushed limestone mine owned and operated by grassy stone llc was located along kentucky highway  about sixteen miles north of grayson carter county kentucky principal operating officials were russell c wilson superintendent and clyde smith supervisor the mine operated two hour shifts a day six days a week total employment was  persons limestone was drilled and blasted in the quarry loaded into haulage trucks by frontend loader and hauled to the primary crusher the material was crushed screened and stockpiled by conveyor belt and frontend loader the finished products were sold for use in the construction industry the last regular inspection of this operation was completed on january   description of accident on the day of the accident clint bloomfield victim reported for work at  pm his normal starting time his usual duties included cleanup work throughout the plant so he began his shift cleaning spilled material from under the primary crusher conveyor belt at about  pm he and clyde smith foreman stopped to discuss making repairs to the bucket of the backhoe afterwards he met up with his father calvin bloomfield laborer to begin cleaning the dust bins it took little time to prepare for cleaning the bins as the plant machinery was not operated on the second shift after the discharge chute door at the bottom of the # dust bin was opened to allow loose material to flow through the bin both clint and calvin bloomfield accessed the upper deck of the tower to enter the bins shortly after clint bloomfield entered the bin calvin bloomfield who was working in the # bin heard a call for help calvin bloomfield immediately exited # dust bin and entered  dust bin where he found his son completely covered with limestone dust he attempted to move the material and expose the victims head but was unsuccessful after working about  minutes calvin bloomfield realized his efforts were in vain so he exited the bin and ran to the backhoe parked below he contacted robert weddington welder on the cb radio who radioed smith who telephoned  for emergency assistance smith used a comealong to open the bins north chute door to allow loose material to flow through the bin until the victims head was exposed weddington and joey davis welder entered the bin and placed the ems supplied oxygen mask on the victims face the victim was recovered through the bottom of the bin and placed on a stretcher the carter county coroner arrived on the scene at  pm and pronounced the victim dead death was attributed to asphyxiation investigation of accident msha was notified of the accident at  pm on march   by a telephone call from russell wilson superintendent to arthur ellis assistant district manager an investigation was started the same day an order was issued pursuant to section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of miners the next day mshas accident investigation team traveled to the mine conducted a physical inspection of the accident scene interviewed persons and reviewed conditions and work practices relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and employees discussion location there were no drawings of the bins and it could not be determined when the bins were installed the general layout of the  dust bin is shown in figure  the accident occurred in the  dust bin one of five bins located sidebyside on the southeast side of the plant at the time of the accident these bins were used to store material that had passed through the plant there was no evidence that indicated whether the victim lost his balance whether material on which he was standing gave way or how he was engulfed inside the bin there were no eye witnesses to the accident work practice bins were cleaned by loosening or punching the material from the walls of the bins primarily by using steel bars the lengths of steel bars found in the plant measured  feet  feet and  feet cleaning of the bins occurred from the access grating at the top of the bins the caked material was also loosened by pushing a steel rod through the material from the bottom bin opening the material from underneath the bins was accessed by standing on the bed cap of a haulage truck employees also worked inside the bins the bottom discharge door or gate would be opened enough to allow loose material to fall from the bin employees entered the bin by holding onto old vbelts attached to a rod that spanned the access area three of the five bins were cleared of caked material in this manner no  bin the bin measured  feet by  feet at the top and had vertical sides for the top  feet the bottom portion of the bin consisted of a hopper with four sides tapering at approximately  degrees from the horizontal the sides of the bin sloped to a foot by foot opening at the bottom two cross braces were set perpendicular to each other inside the bin the braces crossed at the center of the bin and were approximately  feet above the bottom of the bin the bottom of the bin was located approximately  feet above ground level the opening at the bottom of the bin was provided with a clamshelltype gate that consisted of two doors one door was pneumatically operated by controls located on the ground level the second clamshell door was functional but did not contain a means to open or close pneumatically the bin was originally designed to discharge material through the bottom doors into trucks that pulled under the bin a side chute was located on the sloping portion of the bin and according to company officials this modification to the bins was made by previous mine owners the opening for the side chute was  inches wide by  inches high the top of the opening was approximately  inches below the transition from the vertical sides to the sloping sides of the bin the centerline of the side chute for the  dust bin was offset laterally from the center of the bin by  inches to route the chute past the plants structural members the side chute was closed with a slide gate however the gate was wired open as part of the normal operation the chute discharged onto a inch conveyor belt that transferred the material onto another belt that transferred it to a stockpile illumination at the bins was provided by a fixed watt metalhalide lamp located on the conveyor to the fines material stockpile about  feet from the  dust bin a large amount of material was caked on the sides of the bin evidence was visible inside the bin indicating a section of the caked material had recently sloughed off a pieshaped section of material was estimated to be  feet long on one side and  feet along the top the thickness of the section varied from about  inches along the top to a thin layer near the center of the bin the wedge material weighed approximately  pounds conditions inside the  dust bin following the accident are shown in figure  material had adhered to the sides of the  dust bin the material thickened toward the bottom of the bin to a narrow nearly cylindrical opening see figure  the opening extended through the caked material to the bottom bin door material in the bin appeared to have a significant percentage of fines that is material passing through a no  sieve a dry gradation check of a sample of material obtained from a pile of material on the ground underneath the # dust bin indicated the content of fines was about  this made the material prone to caking especially when it absorbed moisture which also inhibited the free flow of the material a portion of the caked material inside the bin had been dug out in the corner of the bin where the side chute was located the dug out area was roughly  feet in diameter at its base the base of the dug out area was approximately at the same level as the top of the side chute but the chute opening was still covered with caked material this is the area where the victim would likely have been digging prior to the accident in his attempt to clear the no  dust bin side chute at the time of the accident there were six v belts hanging in the  dust bin figure  and  three v belts were hanging from a  inch bar located above the top edge of the bin two of the belts had a second belt looped on them forming a belt of double length the single belt extended about  feet from the bar one of the double belts extended about  feet down from the bar and the other doubled belt was embedded in the bin material another belt was looped over one of the cross braces inside the bin given the cross brace location and the length of the belt the end of this belt was located about  feet above the bottom of the bin experience and training the victim had  weeks and  days mining experience reportedly he had received cfr part  new miner training however documentation was not available to show details of the training the majority of the training was provided by a person not listed on the training plan weather when the accident occurred the temperature was in the low s and freezing rain was falling root cause analysis the following causal factors were identified causal factor management policies and controls were inadequate procedures had not been established to ensure employees were protected from the sliding material hazards when they entered the # dust bin miners entered this bin and routinely cleared blockages but were not provided with safety belts or harnesses attached to lifelines a second person was not present to ensure the lifeline was kept tight corrective action a risk assessment should be performed to identify all possible hazards management should develop written procedures that require the use of fall protection an attendant and the use of staging or platforms when necessary to enter a bin causal factor management policies and controls were inadequate and failed to ensure that miners received training in the health and safety aspects and safe work procedures related to cleaning bins there was no documentation to verify that the victim was adequately task trained on how to safely unplug or clean the plant bins corrective action procedures should be developed and implemented to safely enable miners to clean bins all miners should be required to be trained in the safe work procedures when bin entry is necessary conclusion the accident occurred because management failed to establish safe operating procedures and methods for bin cleaning the victim had not received training in the health and safety aspects relating to the task being performed he was not wearing a safety belt or harness with a lifeline attached a second person similarly equipped was not present to adjust or keep the victims lifeline tight violations order no  was issued on march   under the provisions of section k of the mine act a fatal accident occurred at this

established to ensure the material used to construct the ramp were adequate the ground was not constructed of materials capable of supporting the weight of the dozer general information fort green mine a phosphate operation owned and operated by mosaic phosphates company was located five miles south of highway  on highway  in bradley polk county florida the principal operating official was charles l morris facility manager the mine normally operated three eighthour shifts a day seven days a week total employment was  persons the last regular inspection at this operation was completed on september   description of accident on the day of the accident john l brinson victim reported to work at  am his normal starting time brinson and his coworkers met with darrell colding float crew supervisor and received work assignments for that day colding told brinson to go to the south side of the old no  cut area and construct a ramp into the water so a pump could be placed there brinson traveled on the dozer to the area where he was to construct the ramp colding arrived shortly afterwards and told brinson that his work looked satisfactory brinson told colding that he would finish the task in a few minutes and colding left the area about  am tony mcvay float foreman arrived at the site and radioed colding to ask if someone was operating a dozer in the old no  cut area but colding did not respond jesse steel assistant mine superintendent heard mcvays radio message and reported that a dozer was being operated in that area mcvay told steel that he saw tracks leading into the water and air bubbles coming from the water but he did not see a dozer colding responded that brinson was operating a dozer in that area mcvay told colding it appeared that the dozer was in the water and asked him to summon help mcvay entered the water and swam toward the dozer he found the top of the dozer was approximately four to five feet under water mcvay located the victim removed him from the cab of the dozer and brought him to the shore when colding arrived mcvay told him to call for emergency medical assistance because brinson was not responsive the float crew arrived and began cardiopulmonary resuscitation brinson was transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead death was attributed to drowning investigation of the accident msha was notified of the accident at  am on september   by a telephone call from larry rials senior safety specialist to emmette c turner mine safety and health inspector an investigation was started the same day an order was issued pursuant to section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners mshas accident investigation team traveled to the mine made a physical inspection of the accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management employees and the miners representative discussion location of the accident the accident occurred at a water filled pit located south of the no  dragline the pit was in an area that had been mined previously and was known as the hc harsh creek cut or as the old no  cut the water filled pit where the accident occurred was about five acres in size and generally circular shaped with several peninsulas located on the eastern and southwestern sides the water in the pit was reportedly  feet deep a berm approximately  to  feet high had been placed around the northern side of the pit based on laboratory test results provided by the company the berm material was classified as fine sand with a trace amount of silt unified soil classification system the dozer pushed about  cubic yards of the berm into the pit the pit was previously mined to a depth of approximately  feet below the original ground surface a strip of land  feet wide separated the water filled pit from the pit where the no  dragline was working an access road was located on the strip of land between the pits the ramp that the victim was constructing was located on the northern side of the pond investigators observed three sets of dozer tracks on the ramp the ramp was  feet wide and was sloped down towards the water at a grade of approximately  percent prior to failure the ramp was approximately  to  feet long and extended into the water approximately  to  feet the remaining portion of the ramp was approximately  feet long and extended past the pond side of the berm approximately  feet a vertical scarp approximately  feethigh was observed at the end of the ramp where it met the water the center of the dozer located approximately  feet from the edge of the scarp was pointing downhill at an angle of ï¿½ and there were no indications that it had rolled dozer the dozer involved in the accident was a  komatsu model dax it had a fully enclosed cab with an external rollover protection system rops and weighed approximately  pounds the dozer was  feet  inches wide  feet  inches long and had a blade capacity of  cubic yards it was equipped with a seat belt after the dozer was extracted from the pit investigators found the right side door was open and the ignition switch was in the off position the joystick gear selector of the dozers transmission was found to be in the reverse first gear position no defects were found on the dozer weather the weather at the time of the accident was partly cloudy and warm with a temperature of about  degrees fahrenheit weather conditions were not a contributing factor training and experience john l brinson had  years mining experience all at this mine he had received training in accordance with  cfr part  additionally brinson had received a month equipment operator task training course root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following causal factors were identified causal factor policies standards and controls were inadequate and failed to ensure that the ramp was designed and constructed of materials capable of supporting the load that it would be subjected to corrective action management should develop and establish procedures to ensure that equipment operators and supervisors are trained to construct ramps capable of supporting the weight of the equipment operating on them the procedures should require that miners visually inspect the ground conditions to identify hazards where ramps are constructed causal factor no risk assessment was conducted to identify all foreseeable hazards and discuss methods to minimize the hazards associated with the construction of the ramp corrective action conduct a risk assessment to identify and eliminate or control any hazards to safely construct the ramp select equipment such as an excavator that can be operated a safe distance from the edge of the water conclusion the accident occurred because the procedures used to construct the ramp were inadequate the ramp was not constructed of materials capable of supporting the weight of the dozer a risk analysis to identify all potential hazards and establish procedures to safely complete this task was not completed prior to building this ramp violations order no  was issued on september   under the provisions of section k of the mine act a fatal accident occurred at this operation on september   when a miner was pushing material with a komatsu  dozer to make a ramp for a water jack installation when the dozer went into the water this order is issued to ensure the safety of all persons at this operation it prohibits all activity at the failed area until msha has determined that it is safe to resume normal mining operations in the area the mine operator shall obtain prior approval from an authorized representative for all actions to recover andor restore operations to the affected area this order was terminated on october   the conditions that contributed to the accident have been corrected and normal mining operations can resume citation no  was issued on november   under the provision of section a of the mine act for a violation of  cfr  a fatal accident occurred at this operation on september   when a dozer was being operated to construct a ramp in the old number  cut area of the mine the victim was using a portion of the berm to construct a ramp into the water filled pit to install a pump the ramp collapsed and the dozer fell into the water the ramp was not designed or constructed of material capable of supporting the weight it was subjected to namely the dozer this citation was terminated on december   the

week total employment was  persons limestone was drilled blasted and loaded into haulage trucks by a frontend loader the material was crushed screened and washed finished products were sold for use in the construction industry the last regular inspection at this operation was conducted on october   description of the accident on the day of the accident paul e harrington victim reported to work at vulcans wilson county quarry at approximately  am harrington parked his personal vehicle and drove his assigned truck to the clarksville quarry to continue work on the new primary crusher project he was an area electrician for vulcan construction and had worked at various vulcan mining operations harrington arrived at the clarksville quarry about  am he met with danny sisk plant manager at the inactive pump control building they discussed removing the pole conduit and pump control building sisk had already completed a preshift examination of the pit area a new primary crushing plant was under construction in the active pit the installation of the highvoltage power line was monitored and overseen by spate r anthony principal engineer vulcan construction material engineering department in knoxville tennessee vulcan construction awarded a contract to dixon electric inc lexington kentucky to install four power poles and approximately  feet of highvoltage power line from the main power line on top of the highwall to the new primary crusher plant location the highvoltage power lines were energized throughout the expansion in accordance with vulcan personnels instructions disconnect fuses with  amp cutouts were installed on two of the poles for future use but were never incorporated into the system no wires were connected to the bottom of the disconnect fuses and the fuses were left in the open position work was completed on the highvoltage power lines on april   chad mccain leadman went to the plant to assist with the startup about  am sisk and mccain met at the inactive pump control building and old power pole they talked about removing the pipe cable conduit power pole and control building they also checked the fuse disconnects on two of the poles and verified the disconnect fuses were in the open position but did not realize they were inoperative they did not discuss whether the highvoltage power lines were energized or not the crane to be used for the pole removal project had to be sent to the plant for other work the crane returned and the power pole was removed about  pm after lunch the pump conduit and wiring were removed from the old pole and moved to the new location and installed on the new pole the pump control building was loaded onto the boom truck and transported to the new location by mccain harrington and william gilbert laborer gilbert backed the truck into position about  pm mccain began operating the boom and started maneuvering the pump control building into position from the left side boom controls but switched to the right side to obtain a better view of the building and crew harrington and gilbert were standing on the ground next to the building helping to push the suspended building into position when the boom inadvertently came in contact with the energized highvoltage power lines electricity was transmitted through the boom down the hoisting cables into the metal building and through harrington causing him to fall down against the energized building gilbert jumped away from the building and mccain jumped down from the boom truck that was also energized the metal building and the outriggers of the boom truck were arcing mccain ordered everyone to move away from the energized components and the victim no one at the mine had the capability to deenergize the highvoltage power lines mccain called the mine office to request help emergency personnel and workers from the clarksville department of electricity were called the power was disconnected grounded and tagged out of service at  pm the victim was pronounced dead at the scene by the montgomery county medical examiner at  pm the cause of death was attributed to electrocution investigation of the accident msha was notified of the

years  weeks of mining experience and  months  days experience with vulcan construction materials not all at this mine he had received training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following factors were identified root cause management policies and controls were inadequate and failed to require that steps were taken to determine if the overhead power line was deenergized before starting the task there were no safe work procedures implemented to ensure that persons were protected while operating equipment near energized highvoltage power lines corrective action a risk assessment should be jointly conducted by all miners to identify and correct all possible hazards and establish safe procedures before beginning any task that involves operating equipment near energized power lines root cause policies and controls were inadequate management failed to communicate and document the recent actions that resulted in power being connected to the newly installed overhead highvoltage lines corrective action site permits should be utilized prior to starting repair or maintenance tasks management and employees should jointly discuss all of the possible hazards that may be encountered documentation should be completed to ensure that procedures used to complete the work protect everyone from possible hazards the entire project should be monitored to ensure compliance with safe operating procedures conclusion the accident occurred because management failed to inform the employees that the power lines had been energized the prior day the power lines were not deenergized and no other precautionary measures were taken before employees were assigned to operate equipment nearby management did not ensure that a risk assessment was conducted with the crew before starting the task to identify all possible hazards and establish safe procedures enforcement actions order no  was issued on april   under the

overview phillip o markhart underground miner age  was fatally injured on january   while operating a roof bolter markhart was installing wire mesh when a large rock fell and struck him the accident occurred because management failed to design and maintain a ground support system in a manner that would control the ground where the bolter operators were performing their assigned tasks a bolt sequence to ensure the safe handling and installation of the welded wire ground support panels was not in place at the time of the accident general information pend oreille mine an underground lead

develop a portion of the mines drifts the principal operating official was christopher c hickey general manager a formal agreement specifying the scope of work was finalized in december  and redpath commenced activities at the pend oreille mine the week of january   redpath normally worked two hour shifts five days a week and employed  persons at the mine the rock was drilled blasted and moved by frontend loaders and trucks to an underground shaft hoist and then to an underground stockpile area the material was transported to the surface by conveyor belts where it was processed by a milling operation the finished products were shipped and sold to commercial industries the last regular inspection at this operation was completed on december   description of accident on january   phillip o markhart victim and monte nelson miner started to work at  pm in the wdj heading drift the heading had been loaded and blasted at the end of day shift after they loaded the shot rock out of the heading with a frontend loader they brought a roof bolter to the heading to start the bolting cycle the grade of the heading was too steep for the roof bolter to climb under its own power so a frontend loader was used to push it into position nelson and markhart then began installing wire mesh and rock bolt supports at approximately  am on january   joel clark shift boss entered the heading talked with the miners and examined the area the roof bolter would not climb the heading again but had to be advanced to continue the bolting cycle clark operated the frontend loader to push the roof bolter forward so the bolting operation could continue and at approximately  am he left the work area clark had pushed the roof bolter forward to a location that placed a portion of the roof bolters work platform beyond the last row of bolts previously installed appendix d  the miners then installed one panel of wire mesh on the left rib with two bolts at approximately  am as they continued to install wire mesh a large rock fell from the roof striking markhart and pushing nelson out of the way nelson could not remove the rock from the victim so he went into the next drift and got josh eoff driller to help him they removed the rock and nelson called for emergency assistance markhart was transported to the surface and then transferred to a local fire station where he was pronounced dead the cause of death was attributed to blunt force trauma investigation of the accident msha was notified of the accident at  am on january   by a telephone call from brad davenport senior safety coordinator to steve cain supervisory mine safety and health inspector an investigation was started the same day an order was issued under the provisions of section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners mshas accident investigation team traveled to the mine conducted a physical inspection of the accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management the contractor the employees a miners representative the local fire department and the county sheriffs office discussion location of the accident the accident occurred near the face in the warren zone the lowest ore body being developed in the mine the face of wdj heading drift was approximately  feet from the last intersection the wdj heading was being developed by redpath they mined this heading beginning approximately  feet north of the way intersection defined by the wdj and doglegged wd headings appendix b the original wd heading was narrowed down and split into the wd drift mined from the mouth to an extent of  feet toward the eastnortheast and the wdj drift mined approximately  feet due north as measured with the clinometer on a handheld transit the floor grade along the original northeasttrending portion of the wd drift was  degrees approximately  percent grade into the way intersection the floor grade increased slightly to  degrees from the center of the way intersection to a position approximately  feet into the wdj drift this was the approximate position at which redpath began mining from this point the floor grade increased to  degrees  percent grade over a distance of approximately  feet before returning to a more moderate grade toward the face geological conditions the geology was characterized by thinly bedded dolomite that strikes northwest and dips  degrees toward the southwest with beds inclined toward the mouth of the wdj drift a prominent two foot wide fault zone was exposed in the face angled from the top right corner downward to the middle of the face where it intersected the floor the fault zone strikes approximately n  degrees e and dips approximately  degrees toward the northwest extending across the back to intersect the left rib about  feet from the drift mouth  appendix c  the fault zone was characterized by shearedout blocks of dolomite with adjacent bedding planes exhibiting drag motion along the sheared zone as exposed in the back the hanging wall block was characterized by a series of closely spaced  inches joints that paralleled the main fault zone roof bolter the roof bolter involved in the accident was manufactured by maclean engineering and marketing co of ontario canada the maclean model mem had a rock drill with a scissor lift work platform the operators tram compartment was equipped with a rollover protective structure rops and a fall protective structure fops certified canopy however the roof bolters elevated work platform from where the rock bolts were installed was not equipped with an operators canopy or any auxiliary roof support jacks this work platform was approximately feet wide and feet long featuring both a vertical adjustment of approximately  feet via a scissors lift linkage and a fronttoback sump capability of approximately  inches the bolting machine was not equipped with a device to handle the  foot by  foot wire mesh panels loading of the wire mesh onto the top of the drill mast and positioning it prior to bolting required handling by the miners positioned on the elevated work platform the bolter had a single mastfeed style drill boom which incorporated an indexing mechanism with one position for drilling and a second for bolt installation this design eliminated the need for drill steel handling but still required manual loading of the roof bolt for each installation although the roof bolter was a singleboom design and the manufacturer advertised it as a oneman operation reportedly a two man crew was always used by redpath the typical operation involved one operator manning the controls either at the main valve bank or via a tethered remote unit and the second person acting as a helper handling the bolts and wire mesh panels maclean engineering literature technical specifications listed a maximum grade of  percent for the model  series roof bolter the floor grade where the roof bolter was positioned at the time of the accident exceeded  percent a violation was issued for using the bolter beyond the manufacturers designed capacity this violation was not determined to have contributed to the accident bolting cycle the written contract between teck cominco american inc and redpath specified that primary ground support would consist of eightfoot swellex bolts on a  foot by  foot pattern with  gauge footwide by  footlong  welded wire mesh fall of ground a shallow cavity was exposed in the center of the main fault zone recognized by freshly exposed joint surfaces that were not coated with dust and also by poorly developed slickensides the cavity was approximately  feet long  feet wide and one foot deep it extended from the right corner of the face and followed the fault zone to the edge of the last panel of unbolted wire mesh the dimensions of the fall cavity contained an estimated  cubic feet of dolomite weighing approximately  pounds the bolter deck was littered with blocky pieces of dolomite ranging in size from  inch to  inches in addition to the main piece of intact rock that covered the victim the largest piece of intact rock on the bolter deck which had been moved to free the victim was approximately  feet long  feet wide and  inches thick at its maximum although it tapered slightly to define a wedgeshaped cross section the intact rock weighed about  pounds drift width varied between  to  feet with a height of  to  feet the blasting pattern reportedly required the outside blast holes to be drilled at the intended rib line and roof line wire mesh bolted to the roof and ribs caught abundant pieces of broken angular roughsurfaced rock rock fragments ranged in size from  inches and were defined by rough fracture surfaces indicative of blasting rather than by smoother more regular surfaces that would be indicative of naturally occurring geologic structures training and experience phillip o markhart had seven years of mining experience and one year of experience operating other roof bolters he began working at this mine on january   and had not received training in accordance with  cfr part  monte l nelson had seven years of mining experience and one year of experience operating a maclean roof bolter he began working at this mine on november   and had received training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following root causes were identified root cause management policies and controls were inadequate and did not ensure that newly hired experienced miners were trained before they were assigned to begin work duties the victim had received site specific training but had not received training on the mines roof control plan and was unfamiliar with the ground conditions at this mine corrective action management should develop and implement plans to train newly hired experienced miners before they are assigned to work root cause management policies and controls were inadequate and did not ensure that persons were protected from fall of ground hazards when they were installing wire mesh the elevated work platform was not equipped with a canopy the bolting machine was not equipped with a device to handle the wire mesh roof support jacks were not provided and a detailed bolt installation sequence was not being utilized to ensure miners were located under supported ground when installing ground support corrective action management should establish policies and controls to ensure that persons can safely install ground support management should monitor persons conducting the task of installing ground support to ensure that policies and controls are effective in protecting the miners conclusion the accident occurred because management failed to design and maintain a ground support system in a manner that would control the ground where the bolter operators were performing their assigned tasks a bolt sequence to ensure the safe handling and installation of the welded wire ground support panels was not in place at the time of the accident the failure to train the victim on the mines roof control plan and to ensure he was familiar with the ground conditions at this mine and understood how to safely install ground support contributed to this accident enforcement action teck

electrician at the mine kinder had installed a used dewatering screen at the plant on may   the screen was powered by two horsepower motors one mounted on the north side of the screen and one on the south side of the screen wayne bell plant manager connected the screen motors on may  and attempted to start them however the north motor caused the circuit breaker to trip several attempts were made to start the motor before bell decided to call an outside electrician curtis morgan a contract electrician with whom kinder contracts on a regular basis was not available that day cormier mentioned to bell that kowarsch had previously given him a business card and might be available bell told cormier to contact kowarsch after arriving at the mine kowarsch checked the north and south motors with a volt meter and discovered that the north motor was damaged bell sent donnie corkran operations manager to elton louisiana to get a new motor while paul oliver dredge operator and brandon lafleur laborer assisted kowarsch with removal of the damaged motor the damaged motor was placed near the plant electrical building kowarsch decided to retest the damaged motor to verify it was unusable while he waited for another motor to arrive he attached a foot length of white cable from the damaged motor to the motor control module in the electrical building kowarsch indicated that the motor was bad and removed the cable from the motor about that time corkran returned from elton with two new motors kowarsch indicated to bell that he wanted to test one of the new motors before installing it about that time bell went to his office to make a phone call the motor was placed on the tailgate of the toyota pickup truck that corkran had been driving kowarsch connected the white cable to the motor and went into the electrical building kowarsch evidently turned on the power at that time because lafleur and oliver said the motor was humming and the motor shaft was turning slowly kowarsch came to the electrical building door and said it was single phasing went back inside and the motor stopped humming he came back outside disconnected the white cable from the motor and said he wanted to check the motor wiring kowarsch went back into the electrical building and returned with a volt meter after checking the motor leads kowarsch commented again that it was single phasing he then went back inside the electrical building and came out again about  pm bell and corkran returned to the tail gate of the pickup truck and saw that kowarsch was reading the wiring instructions on the inside of the motor cover weather head kowarsch told bell he needed to make some changes to the motor leads after regrouping the motor leads kowarsch said he was ready to reconnect the white cable to the motor kowarsch reached down to the ground and picked up the white cable with one hand then grasped the bare conductors with his other hand he made a noise bent over and fell against the tailgate of the pickup bell positioned himself behind kowarsch and jerked the white cable out of his hands kowarsch then fell to the ground on his backside oliver ran inside the electrical building and shut off the power at the circuit breaker corkran brushed the backside of his hand against kowarschs body to verify that he was not energized then instructed bell to get help while he lafleur and stephen chaney laborer began cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr bell went to the break room and called for emergency medical services ems returned with a protective barrier from a firstaid kit and assisted the others with cpr ems arrived about  pm and transported kowarsch to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead investigation of the accident msha was notified at  pm on the day of the accident by a telephone call from wayne bell to mitchell adams assistant district manager an investigation was started the next day an order was issued pursuant to section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of miners an accident investigation team from msha traveled to the mine made a physical inspection of the accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and employees discussion location of the accident the accident occurred about  feet from the door of the plant electrical building the area was flat and dry the weather was clear and sunny the victim was standing on a concrete pad motor the motor being tested was rated horsepower and was to have been installed on a deister vibrating dewatering screen it had nine external lead wires connected to the internal electrical fields connecting each phase wire of the incoming power to a correct delta grouping of three motor leads would have resulted in the motor operating at  volts similarly connecting each phase wire of the incoming power to one correct motor lead each would have resulted in the motor operating at  volts connecting the incoming phase wires to any other grouping of the motor leads would have resulted in some fault condition for the motor such as single phasing motor control module the motor control module was located in the plant electrical building and contained a motor starter circuit breaker and other control circuitry the motor starter was a nema size # with heater strips that were sized appropriately the control circuit for the motor starter operated at  volts single phase the motor starter controls located in the plant control building were in the off position at the time of the accident however the contacts in the cphase circuit of the motor starter were fused together when inspected even though it was not possible to determine when this defect occurred investigators believe the contacts fused together while kowarsch was testing the new motor and that this condition contributed to the accident the circuit breaker was a ampere thermal magnetic type with an instantaneous trip adjusted to the maximum  amperes since the motor nameplate rating was  amperes at  volts the instantaneous trip should have been set no higher than  amperes which was approximately  percent of the rated fullload current of  amperes although this condition constituted a violation of a mandatory safety standard it did not contribute to the accident and was cited separately white cable the white cable used to test the damaged motor and the new motor was a foot section of romex type cable that was cut onsite from a foot spool the cable had three # awg conductors and a ground wire the cable was rated for  volts training and experience joseph kowarsch was a master electrician with  years experience and worked at this mine for about two hours but had no other mining experience he had received sitespecific hazard awareness training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following factors were identified causal factor management policies and controls were inadequate and failed to require that the electrical circuit was deenergized locked out tagged and tested before work was performed on the circuit management and the contractor failed to discuss the possible hazards and all actions necessary to safely complete the maintenance task corrective action management should conduct a risk assessment with each contractor to identify and correct all possible hazards and establish safe procedures before the contractor begins work at the mine conclusion the accident occurred because safe operating procedures were not implemented to ensure that the electrical circuit was deenergized locked out tagged and tested prior to performing work on the circuit management failed to discuss all safety hazards and safety requirements with the contractor prior to commencement of the assigned task enforcement actions kinder sand company llc order no  was issued on may   under provisions of section k

accident investigators traveled to the mine conducted a physical inspection of the accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed documents conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and employees discussion location of accident the accident occurred at the intersection of a haul road and rail siding located at the companys rail load out area the siding was approximately  feet long and ran parallel to the main line track  feet away the slope on this siding varied from approximately ï¿½ to ï¿½ percent the area where the siding was located was used for stockpiling the material to be loaded in the rail cars and was separated from the remainder of the mine by the main line track at the time of the accident the haul truck was empty and traveling down grade it was returning to the main section of the mine after dumping a load of material in one of the stockpiles the average gradient of the  feet section of road before the track crossing was  percent rail cars the rail cars involved in the accident were two csx open hopper bottom dump type rail cars designed to haul approximately  tons seventeen rail cars were on the siding at the time of the accident in addition to the two cars involved in the accident nine rail cars remained to be loaded the six rail cars already loaded had been gravity dropped to the location where they were to be picked up by a main line locomotive each of the cars had the empty weight of the car along with the maximum allowed cargo weight for that car painted in large numbers on each side of the car the car that the victim was riding had an empty weight of  lbs and a cargo carrying capacity of  lbs the second car involved in the accident had an empty weight of  lbs and a cargo carrying capacity of  lbs each of the cars had been loaded with approximately  lbs of gravel making the total weight of each car with load approximately  lbs the hoppers on each of the cars were approximately  ï¿½ feet long the distance from the ends of each of the hoppers to the center of the couplers was approximately  feet making the total distance between the center of the couplers on each car approximately  ï¿½ feet the rail cars had a shoe type brake when the brake was applied a single composite lined shoe was pushed against each of the steel wheels when the cars were connected to the locomotive an air cylinder activated the brakes each car had a single air cylinder located on one end that activated the linkage that engaged the brake on both ends of the car the brake linkages on each end of the rail cars were connected by a rod that passed through the center of each car the brake linkage was designed in such a way that no brake force was applied to the wheels until all of the shoes came in contact with the wheels when the rail cars were not connected to the locomotive the brake system on each rail car could be manually applied by using a hand wheel the wheel was located close to the top of the edge of the rail car on the same end as the air cylinder when the hand wheel was turned a chain wrapped around the hand wheel axle this chain pulled on a rod that was a part of the linkage that activated the same linkage as the air brake cylinder as the hand wheel rotated the rail car brakes would be applied the investigators determined that the brakes on the rail cars functioned normally haul truck the haul truck involved in the accident was a euclid r offroad haul truck that had an air over hydraulic actuated brake system it had a wet disc brake at each rear wheel that provided the service braking force for the rear axle each of the front wheels had a caliper disc brake to provide the service braking force the service brake was activated by a foot operated treadle valve when the operator would push the foot control the treadle valve would supply air to the air actuated hydraulic master cylinders the hydraulic master cylinders supplied the hydraulic pressure needed to activate the service brakes the truck park brake was an air released spring applied drum brake in the driveline of the truck the

brake but the loader engine revved up and moved forward causing the bucket to contact the conveyor belt frame moore realized his foot was on both the fuel and brake pedal he then removed his foot from the fuel pedal and applied the brake combs was almost knocked from the belt when the loader made contact with the conveyor belt frame he was standing on moore then backed up and lowered the loader bucket to the ground got out of the cab and found creech lying in the bucket combs traveled down the belt and told ratliff to call emergency medical assistance ratliff drove to the shop where he told personnel to call for help emergency medical personnel arrived at the scene and creech was pronounced dead by the powell county coroner death was attributed to crushing chest injuries investigation of the accident msha was notified of the accident at  pm on may   by a phone call from tracey bubnick corporate safety manager to donald ratliff supervisory mine safety and health inspector an investigation was started the same day an order was issued under the provisions of section  k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners mshas accident investigators traveled to the mine conducted a physical inspection of the accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed documents conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and employees discussion location of the accident the accident occurred at the no  conveyor belt located in the secondary crusher plant area of the mine the conveyor belt roller being replaced was  feet  inches above the ground weather weather conditions were not a contributing factor the weather on the day of the accident was partly cloudy and warm with temperatures ranging from  to  degrees fahrenheit equipment the frontend loader involved in the accident was a  komatsu wheel loader model walc  with a fully enclosed cab it weighed approximately  pounds and was powered by a cummins model  diesel engine the transmission had four forward and four reverse speeds and a neutral position the service brake and parking brake system tests were conducted with no load in the bucket on a  percent grade the frontend loader was inspected and no defects were found with the braking system steering system and throttle linkage records a review of mine operators inspection records indicated that the mine operator had kept uptodate maintenance records on the komatsu model wa loader and a preoperational check had been conducted the day of the accident training and experience benny creech had  years mining experience all at this mine he had received training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following root causes were identified root causes management policies and controls were inadequate and failed to require that the proper equipment was provided to safely complete the repair task managements supervision was inadequate and did not ensure that the raised loader bucket was secured and the equipment was blocked to prevent movement prior to persons working from the loader bucket management policies and controls were inadequate management failed to ensure that employees received adequate training in the health and safety aspects and safe working procedures relating to the task they were assigned the miner operating the loader did not demonstrate the correct skills or knowledge to maintain control of the equipment he was assigned to operate corrective actions procedures should be established to provide adequate training to employees before they operate mobile equipment classroom training that includes a through review of the operators manual should be provided prior to operating mobile equipment written safety rules and requirements should be made a handson part of task training a risk assessment should be conducted for each assigned task to identify and correct all possible hazards and establish safe work procedures conclusion the accident occurred because safe operating procedures were not established to ensure that miners had the correct equipment or training to safely replace a takeup roller from an elevated position management did not conduct a risk assessment to identify all possible hazards and establish safe work procedures for the assigned task

central district  commerce street room  dallas teas  edward e lopez district manager overview on september   james c kampert repairman age  was fatally injured when the water truck he was operating crashed at the bottom of the mines slope entrance the accident occurred because mine management did not adequately direct and control activities on mine property the water truck owned by a nearby asphalt plant was placed in service to address dusty conditions in the mine even though braking systems on the truck had not been maintained in functional condition general information stamper quarry an underground limestone operation owned and operated by hunt martin materials llc was located in kansas city platte county missouri the principal operating official was gerald kuper plant manager the mine operated two hour production shifts si days per week limestone was drilled blasted and crushed underground then conveyed to the surface finished products were sold for use in the construction industry total employment was  persons superiorbowen asphalt company a subsidiary of clarkson construction company owned and operated two asphalt plants at stamper quarry one of these plants was located a few hundred yards from the slope entrance into the mine the other plant was located across the road from the mine entrance the last regular inspection of the mine was completed on august   description of the accident on the day of the accident james kampert victim and jesus balderaz loader operator reported for work at  pm their normal starting time their normal duties at the beginning of the shift were to service the underground mobile equipment and start the underground primary crusher gerald kuper plant manager was out of state that day kelly wilson day shift assistant plant manager had left the mine after his shift ended at  pm larry hudgins night shift assistant plant manager normally came in about  pm but arrived about  pm on the day of the accident kampert and balderaz went underground and returned to the surface for the nightly staff meeting at  pm hudgins typically did not offer much direction to his employees because he believed they all knew what to do however hudgins did tell kampert who had worked at the mine less than three months to assist him later in the shift with repairs to one of the mines two water trucks both of which were out of service and located at the surface shop he also read aloud a note from wilson stating that the day shift had borrowed a water truck from superiorbowen that day to water the mines surface roads hunt martin was unable to produce wilsons note but it reportedly did not specify which water truck was borrowed or who had driven it superiorbowen typically filled their water trucks at stamper quarrys fresh water pond their water truck drivers sometimes watered the mines surface roads as they left the property superiorbowen sometimes loaned mobile equipment with a driver to the mine but did not usually send equipment underground even though they had done so two days in june  on the day of the accident a superiorbowen truck and driver had been sent from the asphalt plant to water the mines surface roads during the day shift in spite of the work superiorbowen did on mine property there were no records of new miner training task training or hazard training for any of their water truck drivers there were also no records of preoperational inspections of the superiorbowen water trucks after the staff meeting kampert drove a service truck underground and worked on a mechanical scaler before helping brad kossen drill operator strike a center line airborne dust was especially bad that day but the mine didnt have a water truck available to water the underground roadways one day prior to the accident kampert had discussed the dusty conditions with todd vandiver drill operator and told mike mclanahan equipment operator that they needed some water on the roadways had there been a water truck available kampert or one of several other employees depending upon who was available would have used it to water the roadways about  pm kampert left kossen and drove out of the mine and traveled a few hundred yards to the asphalt plant where he parked his service truck and got into a water truck owned by superiorbowen hudgins thought this was the same water truck referred to in wilsons note but investigators determined that it was not the asphalt plant was closed for the day but the water truck keys had been left in the cab even though superiorbowen reportedly locked them in the office every evening representatives of both superiorbowen and hunt martin said kampert had not been authorized to use the truck kyle johnson night shift plant operator at the mine saw the water truck pass through the screening plant and travel toward the fresh water pond about  pm kampert apparently filled the water truck at the fresh water pond and drove it down the slope entrance into the mine the evidence at the bottom of the slope indicated that the truck was going at a high rate of speed when it traveled through a pile of wooden timbers and onto a rock berm the impact of the crash separated the cab and water tank from the truck frame kevin curtis ponciano flores and merle england members of the powder crew heard a loud noise and went to the accident scene hudgins was called to the area and located the victim among the wooden timbers just south of the berm hudgins traveled to the surface and called for emergency medical assistance kampert was pronounced dead at the scene by a representative of the office of the jackson county medical eaminer death was attributed to blunt force injuries investigation of the accident msha was notified of the accident at  pm on september   by a telephone call from jeff hall superintendent to mitchell adams assistant district manager an investigation was started the same day an order was issued pursuant to section  k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners mshas accident investigation team traveled to the mine made a physical inspection of the accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the help of mine management and employees osha conducted a separate investigation at superiorbowen at the request of msha because superiorbowen would not participate in the msha investigation discussion location of the accident the accident occurred at the intersection of the  entry and the  north crosscut in the underground mine the intersection was  feet north of the slope bottom and was about  feet long and  feet wide rock berms had been constructed  feet high at each entrance to the intersection to prevent eposure to loose ground in the intersection several dozen wooden timbers were stored just south of the intersection of the  entry and the  north crosscut each of the timbers was si inches square and four feet long slope entrance the slope entrance into the mine was  feet long  feet wide  feet high and declined  percent from south to north there was a inch conveyor along the west left side of the slope the east right side of the slope was used for personnel and equipment to enter and eit the mine water truck the truck involved in the accident was a  ford model lt that had been retrofitted with a gallon  lbs water tank the truck had a single front ale dual rear ales and a gross rated capacity of  pounds the truck was owned by superiorbowen asphalt and was parked with the keys in it at the asphalt plant a few hundred yards from the mine brake system description the truck was equipped with epanding shoe drum brakes which were activated by air applied brake chambers on both sides of the trucks front steering and rear tandem ales both sides of the front tandem ale were equipped with epanding shoe drum brakes that were activated with combination air and spring applied brake chambers the ford lseries chassis for this water truck was originally manufactured with type  maibrake chambers on both tandem ales and type  air chambers on the steering ale the maibrake chambers had both a spring applied park brake actuator and an air applied service brake actuator the brake system on the truck was designed to use the spring brake to make a modulated spring brake application when the air supply to the primary brake system was low or ehausted the air to activate the service brake system was supplied by a dual footoperated control which kept the primary and secondary service system isolated during normal braking when the footoperated control valve was engaged air from the secondary brake circuit was supplied directly to the front brake air chambers the footoperated control supplied pressure from the primary brake circuit to activate two relay valves which supplied air from the primary brake system to the four air chambers on the rear ales as originally manufactured the park brake system was provided with four springapplied airreleased maibrake actuators located at each wheel on the tandem ales the air pressure to the park brake control valve came from a double check valve which received air pressure from both the primary and secondary air system the park brake air control valve was controlled by a toggle switch this valve was not designed to dump the pressure in the park brake system to fully apply the park brake when the pressure in the air system pressure lowered to  psi brake chambers prior to the accident the original type  air activated chambers on the front steering ale had been replaced with type  air activated service brake chambers these smaller chambers on the steering ale reduced the available braking force when the service brake was applied the front tandem ale had mismatched combination parkservice brake maibrake chambers the type  combination parkservice brake maibrake chamber spring brake on the right side of the front tandem ale had been replaced with a type  combination parkservice brake maibrake chamber this change reduced the available service braking force at the right wheels on the front tandem ale the  combination parkservice brake chamber on the rear tandem ale had been replaced with type  air activated service brake chambers replacing the maibrake chambers on the rear ale with type  air only chambers reduced the braking force of the parking brake system by  percent using the type  air chambers on the rear ale rather than the type  maichambers also reduced the available braking force when the service brake was applied brake drum and lining evaluation the brake drums were removed from each wheel and the drum diameter and the brake lining thickness were checked none of the brake drums eceeded the manufacturers maimum in service diameter each of the brake linings had at least ï¿½ inch of friction material there was no oil or grease on the drums or brake linings brake adjustment checks the push rod strokes of the front ale were measured by applying  psi shop truck air to the brake chambers this shop air simulated service braking during operation the right side had a stroke of  inches which eceeded the maimum allowable stroke of  ï¿½ inches for a type  brake chamber by ï¿½ inch the stroke on the left side was  ï¿½ inches which eceeded the maimum allowable stroke by ï¿½ inches one of the chambers on the front steering ale had a significant air leak when air pressure was applied during the test because the accident and recovery caused damage to the air chambers and the air chamber mounts the strokes could not be checked on the front and rear tandem ales rust and dirt on the wear surfaces of the rear tandem ale drums indicated the shoes were not touching the drums when the service brakes were applied the rollers on the brake shoes had been rolling on the scams indicating air was getting to the rear brake assemblies and operating the scams however the brakes were out of adjustment to the point the shoes did not contact the wear surfaces of the brake drums on the rear tandem ale the brake shoes had been contacting the wear surfaces of the brake drums on the front tandem ale indicating the brake was working on both sides of this ale air supply system description the air for the brake system was supplied by an engine driven air compressor the air from the compressor was stored in two tanks the air tanks included a combination supplysecondary tank and a primary tank the air system had check valves to isolate the primary and secondary air system from each other so a loss of air in one system would not deplete the air in the other system transmission the truck had an allison model mtrm speed automatic transmission which was controlled by a gear shift lever to the right of the operator the gear shift was connected to the shift lever on the outside of the transmission by a pushpull cable during the accident the transmission separated from the rest of the truck the top cover was taken off the transmission to observe the gears no damage was found on the gears inside the transmission the transmission gear shift lever was found in first gear training and eperience james kampert had  year and  weeks of mining eperience he had worked  weeks at this mine kampert had received training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following causal factors were identified causal factor managements policies and procedures failed to ensure that all activities on mine property were adequately overseen by supervision corrective action management should establish policies and procedures to ensure that employees are adequately supervised causal factor managements safety process failed to ensure that miners were provided a safe and healthy working environment corrective action management should establish a safety process that ensures miners do not have to work in ecessively dusty conditions causal factor managements policies and procedures failed to ensure that selfpropelled mobile equipment with defective brakes was not utilized by employees corrective action management should establish policies and procedures to ensure that safety defects are identified and corrected before selfpropelled mobile equipment is placed in service conclusion the accident occurred because mine management did not adequately direct and control activities on mine property the water truck owned by a nearby asphalt plant was placed in service to address dusty conditions in the mine even though braking systems on the truck had not been maintained in functional condition enforcement actions order no  was issued on september   under the provisions of section k of the mine act a fatal

fatally injured on may   when the dozer he was operating fell into a water filled pit the victim had been pushing the top layer of dirt and vegetation from reclaim piles into adjacent water filled ponds the accident occurred because safe operating procedures were not established to ensure the dozer could safely push material into the pond an examination of the ground conditions at the edge of the bank was not completed prior to work commencing management did not conduct a risk assessment to identify all possible hazards and establish safe work procedures for the assigned task general information hookers prairie mine a phosphate operation owned by mosaic fertilizer llc mosaic was located at polk bradley county florida the principal operating official was dave spedden mine manager the mine normally operated three eighthour shifts per day seven days a week total employment was  persons mcdonald construction corporation mcdonald an earthmoving contractor was located in lakeland florida the principal operating official was keith hancock supervisor land reclamation mcdonald was contracted by mosaic to reclaim land at their mine sites the victim was presently assigned to the mined out area being reclaimed by mcdonald for mosaic mcdonald employed  employees at this mine they worked one hour shift  days a week draglines were used to strip  to  feet of overburden and pile the material into the adjacent open mining cut the ore called matrix was then mined into a slurry pit and pumped through a inch pipeline to the wash plant that would break up the clay in the ore and separate the ore into three components the sand was pumped back to the mining cuts to be used as part of the material for land reclamation phosphate rock from the washer and flotation plant was loaded into rail cars and shipped to mosaic chemical plants for further processing into fertilizer the reclaimed areas included flat land lakes wetlands and low sand hills the last regular inspection at this operation was conducted june   description of accident on the day of the accident john frymire victim reported to work at  am his normal starting time herman acorn supervisor drove frymire to a dozer and directed him to push the top layer of soil and vegetation off the earthen sand piles into the water filled ponds in preparation for the surveying crew acorn left frymire and went to direct other employees work assignments about  am acorn drove through the reclaim area and saw frymire pushing topsoil and grass into the pond aubrey pellom service truck operator arrived at the reclaim area around  pm to service the dozer pellom contacted his supervisor by radio and reported that he couldnt find the dozer or the dozer operator when acorn arrived he saw the top of the bulldozer partially visible above the surface of the pond but he could not see the victim acorn called paul e abbey mcdonalds maintenance supervisor for help when abbey arrived he donned a life preserver and waded out to the dozer dirt and mud had fallen in around the dozers right side cab door making it difficult to open abbey opened the door reached inside and felt the victim still in the operators seat he pulled the victim out of the seat took the life preserver he was wearing and placed it on frymire abbey then found the victims life preserver inside the cab placed it on himself and returned to the shore the polk county sheriffs department arrived along with local paramedics who pronounced the victim dead the cause of death was attributed to drowning investigation of the accident msha was notified of the accident at approximately  pm by telephone from dellwood mcdonald safety director for mcdonald construction to curtis roth supervisory mine safety and health inspector an investigation was started the same day an order was issued under the provisions of section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners mshas accident investigation team traveled to the mine conducted a physical inspection of the accident scene interviewed employees and contractors and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management employees and the contractors the sheriffs department emergency medical services and the medical examiner of polk county also assisted discussion location of the accident the accident occurred in a reclamation area at a location identified as south cr reclamation project consisting of approximately  acres on the day of the accident mcdonald had three bulldozers working on this project stripping vegetation from piles of waste material spoil piles the site included ponds and dragline spoil piles equipment the caterpillar dr track dozer involved in the accident was owned by mcdonald the dozer weighed  pounds and had a blade capacity of  cubic yards this capacity of overburden material could potentially place a maximum of  lbs of additional weight on the edge of the bank the dozer was equipped with a rolloverprotection enclosed cab and had a manually operated blade and tramming controls the dozer seat was equipped with a seatbelt after the pond was dewatered the dozer was found in reverse gear with the blade up and the blade end facing the pond overburden material the overburden material that formed the bankpile consisted of sand with some silts the sand was not dense but was in a very loose state which was consistent of sand placed by casting the loose condition of the sand was verified by standard penetration testing performed by the operator during exploratory drilling of the accident area the very loose condition of the sand made it very susceptible to sliding or sloughing from vibrations and the weight of the dozer during recovery operations of the dozer vibrations generated from equipment working adjacent to but not on the bank appeared to have caused an additional footwide portion of the crest of the failure face to slide or slough off of the eastern end of the bank the angle of repose for cast overburden at the mine was  degrees foot of horizontal run to  feet of vertical rise approximately  feet arc length or perimeter of material along the west side of the bank slidmoved when the failure occurred the scarp that remained following the failure varied in height between approximately three feet to six feet mining in the accident area was conducted by a previous mine owner over  years ago twenty to  feet of overburden was removed to uncover the phosphate ore the overburden piles consisted of siltysand the phosphate ore matrix was located  to  feet below the surface and the thickness of the matrix varied between  and  feet based upon the height of water pumped out of the pond and measurements taken after the accident the water surface was between five and eight feet below the crest of the bank the sloughed overburden and sediments had filled the pit to  feet below the crest of the bank water had collected on the east and west side of the bank to form ponds on the day of the accident the water level on the east side of the bank was one foot higher than the pond on the west side this head differential was not significant enough to cause large seepage forces within the bank which could lead to slope failure however having water against both sides of the bank contributed to a larger area of the soil in the bank being saturated the areas where the soil was saturated were more prone to sloughing weather the weather on the day of the accident was partly cloudy and warm with temperatures ranging from  to  degrees fahrenheit medical analysis toxicology laboratory results found the victims blood alcohol was  percent and established that he would have been impaired positive cocaine results were also established however it could not be determined if these levels would have impaired the victim training and experience john w frymire had  years and  weeks total mining experience he was a contract dozer operator for mcdonald construction llc and had received training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following causes were identified root causes managements policies and controls were inadequate and failed to require a person experienced in examining ground conditions to examine the edge of the ponds procedures were not developed to safely complete the task the mine operator did not ensure that the contractor had established safe procedures for pushing top soil into the ponds management failed to complete a risk assessment to identify possible hazards and they failed to communicate to the miners the safety aspects and safe working procedures relating to the task they were assigned procedures were not in place to identify possible alcohol use during the work shift corrective action procedures should be established to identify significant tasks and jointly conduct a risk assessment with miners to identify and correct all possible hazards and establish safe work procedures management should develop and implement policies addressing substance abuse conclusion the accident occurred because safe operating procedures were not established to ensure the dozer could safely push material into the pond an examination of the ground conditions at the edge of the bank was not completed prior to work commencing management did not conduct a risk assessment to identify all possible hazards and establish safe work procedures for the assigned task enforcement actions mosaic fertilizer llc order no  was issued on may

mammenga and a coworker were towing the conveyor with a steel chain hooked from the loader bucket to the tail end of the conveyor the conveyors movement was halted when the hydraulically operated radial wheels contacted the ground when mammenga raised the radial wheels the conveyor moved suddenly and struck him the accident occurred because the operating procedures used to tow the conveyor were inadequate procedures had not been implemented to ensure that a solidtype hitch tow bar or other effective means was used to safely tow the stacking conveyor general information crusher # a portable surface sand and gravel operation owned and operated by tricity paving inc was located at pine city pine county minnesota the principal operating officials were john d surma president and daniel j surma vice president the mine normally operated two hour shifts per day and five days a week total employment was four persons material was mined from the pit with a rubbertired frontend loader crushed screened and then stockpiled by conveyor the finished product was used onsite at the company asphalt batch plant and sold for construction aggregate the last regular inspection of this operation was completed on november   description of accident on the day of the accident mitchel l mammenga victim reported for work at  am his normal starting time mammenga and joshua reith frontend loader operator discussed the operation of the plant with two night shift employees performed some cleanup around the plant and resumed crushing road gravel for about ï¿½ hours after changing screens on the plant they decided to move the radial stacking conveyor to make a separate road gravel stockpile for a customer about  am reith was towing the radial stacking conveyor with a steel chain hooked from a rubbertired frontend loader bucket to the tail end of the conveyor which was the normal procedure used to move the conveyor the conveyors movement was halted when the hydraulically operated radial wheels contacted the ground reith told mammenga that the conveyor wouldnt move mammenga went to the hydraulic controls mounted on the conveyor support structure in front of the left side tandem wheels while mammenga was raising the radial wheels the conveyor moved because the loader still had tension on the chain mammenga was unable to get out of the way and the tandem wheels struck and rolled over him reith towed the conveyor for approximately  feet turned the tail end of the conveyor set it down and disconnected the chain from the conveyor he noticed mammenga lying on the ground

medical assistance arrived the victim was pronounced dead at the scene by the pine county deputy sheriff death was attributed to multiple trauma investigation of the accident msha was notified of the accident at  am on october   by a telephone call from john d surma president to russell t jarvi jr supervisory mine safety and health inspector an investigation began on the same day an order was issued pursuant to section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners mshas accident investigation team traveled to the mine conducted a physical inspection of the accident site interviewed employees and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management employees the mine operators safety consultant and the pine county sheriffs department discussion location of the accident the accident occurred at the plant area of the portable screeningcrushing plant located at the center of the sand and gravel pit the area was dry and sloped slightly from the stacking conveyor to the frontend loaders position stacking conveyor the conveyor involved in the accident manufactured by nordberg did not have any other identifying information it was  feet long  feet wide and equipped with a  inch wide conveyor belt according to the manufacturer the conveyor was probably a model  that would have originally weighed approximately  pounds but was modified by the mine operator by adding two hydraulically controlled outriggers one outrigger on each side had a inchdiameter tire mounted on the outrigger structure when these outriggers were lowered the tires would contact the ground raising the conveyors overtheroad tandem wheels and allowing the conveyor to move in a radial direction the outriggers were positioned near ground level and served to assist the stability of the conveyor when it was towed in a raised position over uneven ground the hydraulic lever controls were located on the side of the conveyor structure approximately  inches from the front wheel nearest the conveyors material loading end the hydraulic lever controls operated the outrigger lift cylinders conveyor boom cylinders and folding cylinders the portable conveyor was equipped with dual axles tandem wheels air brakes and a fifth wheel hitch for overtheroad transportation frontend loader the caterpillar g wheel loader used to tow the radial stacking conveyor had an articulated frame and was powered by a sixcylinder model  caterpillar diesel engine it weighed approximately  pounds and had an electronically controlled transmission with four forward and four reverse speeds and a neutral position the loader was equipped with fourwheel hydraulic oilcooled completely enclosed multipledisc service brakes the service brakes could be applied using either of two pedals located on either side of the steering column pushing the left side pedal also neutralized the transmission service brake and parking brake grade holding tests were conducted with the bucket empty and facing downhill the service brakes stopped and held the wheel loader on a grade of approximately  percent the loader parking brake was found to be defective but it was not being used at the time of the accident and was not considered a factor in the accident a noncontributory citation was issued towing chain a ï¿½inch steel chain approximately  feet long was used to tow the conveyor one end of the chain approximately  inches from the end of the chain was connected to a grab hook on the loader bucket the other end of the chain was connected to the ringtype tow hitch mounted on the foot of the conveyor with a ï¿½ inch clevistype eye hook the chain and loader bucket connection method permitted tugging and swaying action to occur when the conveyor was being towed weather conditions on the day of the accident the skies were clear with a temperature of approximately  degrees fahrenheit training and experience mitchel l mammenga had a total of  years  weeks and  days of experience at this mining operation and had received training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following causal factors were identified causal factor policies standards and controls were inadequate procedures had not been established to safely tow the conveyor the conveyor was not towed with a properly sized tow bar or any other effective means of control corrective action management should establish procedures requiring that properly sized tow bars or other effective means of control are used for towing or pushing equipment causal factor the miners failed to recognize the hazard associated with using a chain to tow equipment corrective action employees should be trained to stop look analyze and manage slam each task to evaluate possible hazards and ensure steps are taken to safely perform the task conclusion the accident occurred because the operating procedures used to tow the conveyor were inadequate procedures had not been implemented to ensure that a solidtype hitch tow bar or other effective means was used to safely move the stacking conveyor enforcement actions

fluoride discharged onto his face dorton was not wearing a respirator or face shield when he opened the valve in preparation for unplugging the stem the accident occurred because management failed to establish procedures to ensure that ie technicians could safely work on vacuum monitoring lines the procedures provided to ie technicians did not require them to wear a respirator or face shield to protect them from hydrogen fluoride exposure additionally the established procedures did not require the ie technicians to use the special wash out tool designed to seal around the clean out drill bit and prevent pressure or hydrogen fluoride from escaping during the clean out procedure general information bayer alumina plant a surface alumina mill owned and operated by alcoa world alumina atlantic a division of alcoa inc was located in point comfort calhoun county texas the principal operating official was john ramos operations manager the mill operated multiple shifts  hours a day  days per week total employment was approximately  persons bauxite ore was shipped to the mill from several foreign sources the ore was conveyed to the mill where the bayer process was used to extract alumina from the bauxite the finished product was used to produce aluminum metal and other materials for a variety of industrial uses the last regular inspection at this operation was completed on august   description of accident on the day of the accident john l dorton victim reported for work at  am his normal starting time dorton and miguel monroy instrumentationelectrical technician were assigned to check and clean the stems of the vacuum monitoring lines on the aluminum fluoride units they worked together for a while then started working separately on the various units this task was performed on a frequent basis at this operation about  pm dorton arrived at the vacuum monitoring line on the number  unit and removed a pipeend plug from the outside valve of the pipe stem when dorton opened the valve hydrogen fluoride discharged onto his face dorton walked to the control room and told albert marek control room operator he had hydrogen fluoride on his face marek called for help and applied calcium gluconate gel a neutralizing agent to dortons face the plant emergency response team arrived a short time later and escorted dorton to a waiting ambulance about  pm dorton was taken to a hospital for medical treatment about  pm he was taken to another hospital via life flight helicopter for advanced medical treatment dorton was pronounced dead at  pm by the attending physician the cause of death was chemical inhalation investigation of accident on the day of the accident msha was notified at  pm by a telephone call from gene rek safety specialist to ralph rodriguez supervisory

traveled to the mine made a physical inspection of the accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management employees and the miners representatives discussion location of accident the accident occurred near one of ten hydrogen fluoride vacuum monitoring lines of the number  aluminum fluoride unit in the chemicals department aluminum fluoride process aluminum fluoride was made by mixing sulfuric acid and fluorspar a mined mineral the mixture was heated in a rotary kiln to produce hydrogen fluoride gas the hydrogen fluoride gas was moved through a condenser to a converter via an inch pipeline where alumina trihydrate was added to make aluminum fluoride the system typically operated under a vacuum of  to  inches water gauge hydrogen fluoride the material safety data sheet msds for hydrogen fluoride was created by management on july   and last revised on july   the msds indicated that hydrogen fluoride a colorless gas with a strong irritating odor is normally found in a fuming liquid or gaseous state contact with hydrogen fluoride can cause severe burns to the eyes mucous membranes skin and respiratory tract acute overexposures can cause coughing shock fluid in the lungs pulmonary edema and death with the effects possibly delayed up to  hours the current ceiling threshold limit value tlv for hydrogen fluoride as determined by the american conference of governmental industrial hygienists was  parts per million  percent it readily dissolves in water to form hydrofluoric acid vacuum monitoring system the hydrogen fluoride vacuum monitoring system consisted of a inch copper tube monitoring line that ran parallel to the vertical inch hydrogen fluoride pipe from the condenser to the converter the monitoring line extended  feet vertically to a vacuum sensor and rotometer used to pressurize the monitoring line during some repairs and maintenance the monitoring line was connected to the inch hydrogen fluoride pipe by a  inch long ï¿½inch diameter pipe stem line that was  inches above the adjacent walkway manual ball valves were installed on either side of the pipe tee connecting the monitoring line to the stem line the valve between the monitoring line and the inch hydrogen fluoride pipe was open during normal operation but had to be closed to isolate the monitoring line and pressurize it the other valve was located on the other side of monitoring line at the end of the pipe and was normally closed and plugged the outer valve had to be open for access to drill through it and remove any blockage in the ï¿½inch pipe the ï¿½inch pipe frequently filled with hydrogen fluoride condensate that formed when warm hydrogen fluoride moved from the inch pipe to the smaller pipe and monitoring line with their greater cooling surfaces relative to the volume of gas the ï¿½inch pipe was slightly declined from the  inch pipe allowing most of the condensation to accumulate near the outer valve after the accident the ball valve closest to the inch pipeline was found closed and the outer ball valve was found slightly open with the pipeend plug removed the monitoring line and stem had apparently been pressurized to check for blockage in the inch monitoring line when the outer valve was opened the pressure released standard work instruction for instrumentationelectrical technicians a standard work instruction swi for instrumentationelectrical ie technicians performing stem cleaning was created on august   and updated in  the swi warned of possible pressure and hydrogen fluoride in the stem but did not require all the appropriate special protective equipment to protect persons properly from all potential hazards the swi required persons to wear a hardhat safety glasses safety toe boots goggles chemical gloves and hearing protection however a respirator or face shield was not required to be worn a step by step sequence for this clean out procedure was not addressed in the swi a special washout tool was available in other departments of the plant but was not provided to the ie technicians in the chemicals department this tool prevents hydrogen fluoride discharge from the stem valve during the clean out procedure the ie technicians were not provided with the same written procedure and policy swi that the maintenance group had been using prior to a departmental reorganization standard work instruction for maintenance employees prior to a departmental reorganization about five years ago maintenance employees performed stem cleaning on a regular basis a standard work instruction swi for maintenance employees performing stem cleaning was created on january   the swi warned of potential hydrogen fluoride drips leaks and sprays it indicated that a hardhat safety glasses monogoggles safety shoes hearing protection hydrogen fluoride cartridge respirator face shield and rubber gloves should be worn it also required the use of a special wash out tool designed to seal around the clean out drill bit and prevent pressure or hydrogen fluoride from escaping during the clean out procedure the swi provided a detailed step by step sequence for the clean out procedure and indicated that assistance should be used when performing the clean out task due to the potential hazards from the hydrogen fluoride training and experience john dorton had  years and  weeks of experience at this operation he had worked one year and nine weeks in the chemicals department and had cleared monitoring line stems periodically throughout that time dorton had received training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following root causes were identified root cause management standards controls and policies were inadequate they failed to require that the appropriate special protective equipment be used by ie technicians assigned to remove blockage within monitoring line stems corrective action management should review all standard work instructions related to possible exposure to chemicals or gases that pose health or safety risks to personnel standard work instructions should be modified as necessary to ensure that employees can safely complete the task of cleaning vacuum monitoring lines conclusion the accident occurred because management failed to establish procedures to ensure that ie technicians could safely work on vacuum monitoring lines the procedures provided to ie technicians did not require them to wear a respirator or face shield to protect them from hydrogen fluoride exposure additionally the established procedures did not require the ie technicians to use the special wash out tool designed to seal

colorado  richard laufenberg district manager overview on july   kent l raikes loader operator age  was fatally injured when the frontend loader he was operating fell into a dredge pond raikes had been using the loader to set an foot section of dredge pipe into the water when the shoreline sloughed into the dredge pond the accident occurred because the procedures failed to adequately address the risks associated with work performed near the dredge pond the mining methods used did not ensure that slope stability could be maintained in places where persons worked or traveled near the dredge pond the waste sand shear strength of the dredge pond was incapable of maintaining a stable slope with the added dynamic of the frontend loader and the dredge pipe general information pit # waterloo a sand and gravel operation owned and operated by lymanrichey sand gravel company was located on us hwy  four miles east of waterloo douglas county nebraska the principal operating official was doug l harrison general manager the mine normally operated one hour shift five days per week total employment was nine persons sand and gravel was mined from a pond with a suction dredge attached to a foot floating discharge pipeline raw material was pumped from the dredge to the plant where it was crushed sized and stockpiled finished products were sold for use as a construction aggregate the last regular inspection of this operation was completed on november   description of accident on the day of the accident kent l raikes victim reported to work at  am his normal starting time doug l harrison general manager assigned raikes steve boothe loader operator and donny harrington dredge operator to perform their normal duties as assigned on the dredge during the shift they determined that an additional section of discharge pipe needed to be added to the system raikes and boothe drove the loaders to the laydown area where the section of pipe fitted with floatation pontoons was located about  pm they positioned the frontend loaders on opposite ends of the foot section of pipe harrington helped them attach a chain to each flange end of pipe and then connected a hook to each loader bucket both frontend loaders then lifted the pipe and transported it from the laydown area to the waters edge raikes backed his loader while boothe drove the other one forward this work progressed without incident about  pm raikes boothe and harrington approached an area along the shoreline where waste sand had been deposited about  or  years ago forming a peninsula that protruded out into the pond raikes backed his loader out toward the water and onto the deposited sand peninsula he positioned the loader and turned to the right facing the water the dredge pipe was disconnected from raikes loader while boothes loader facing the waters edge was still chained to the pipe the dredge pipe was positioned with the first two floatation pontoons in the water off the end of the peninsula and the last two still on shore chained to boothes loader boothe placed the loader bucket on the ground preparing to disconnect the dredge pipe boothe observed the shoreline beginning to fail where raikes loader was parked he noticed the shoreline sinking into the pond and radioed raikes to get out but he did not respond as harrington was moving the work boat into position he noticed the pipe was moving and saw raikes loader sinking into the pond boothe dismounted his loader and yelled to harrington to come to shore and get him so they could attempt to rescue raikes booth and harrington reached the submerged loader and dove several times but were unable to open the door of the cab harrington broke the rear window on the cab with a hammer he opened the cab door and recovered raikes harrington and boothe got raikes into the work boat and started cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr when they reached the shore harrison called for emergency medical assistance emergency medical personnel arrived and airlifted the victim to a hospital where he was pronounced dead the cause of death was attributed to drowning investigation of the accident the mine safety and health administration was notified of the accident at  pm on july   by a telephone call from stanley e benke jr corporate safety manager to michael dennehy supervisory special investigator an investigation was started the same day an order was issued under the provisions of section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners mshas accident investigators traveled to the mine made a physical inspection of the accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and employees discussion location of the accident the accident occurred on the northern shore of the dredge pond on hydraulically deposited dredge tailings the dredge tailings bank was part of a sand dike that separated the dredge pond from a smaller water storage pond the dredge pond was on the south side of the dike and the water storage pond was on the north side the dike was approximately  feet wide in the vicinity of the failure neither pond was provided with a liner water surface elevations were maintained near the top of the dike the ground water table appeared to be consistently shallow throughout the dike because it was narrow and sandy and the water surface elevations were high relative to the top of the dike this condition created a correspondingly shallow zone of saturated sand in close proximity to the ground surface location of the loader tire tracks on the perimeter of the largest failure scarp suggested that the loader involved in the accident was approximately  to  feet away from the prefailure shoreline at the time of failure based on a description of the maneuvers made by the loader and the orientation of the tire tracks it appeared the loader was operating generally perpendicular to the prefailure shoreline and was facing southeast toward the dredge pond at the perimeter of the failure scarp the loader was operating approximately four feet above the ground water table and the corresponding zone of saturated sand the submerged loader was located approximately  feet from the postfailure shoreline the depth of the pond at this location was approximately  feet the loader was found in an upright position facing to the southeast and away from the postfailure shoreline the roof of the loader cab was approximately  feet below the water surface cause of the failure the failed area was delineated by three arcshaped failure surfaces each surface was characterized by a distinct failure scarp the largest scarp was located in the area where the victims loader had been operating the two smaller scarps were located immediately to the west of the largest scarp the largest scarp represented the initial stage of the failure the two smaller scarps represented subsequent failure stages occurring in conjunction with the loss of lateral support caused by the initial failure stage the length of the failed area along the shoreline was approximately  feet the estimated width of the failed area from the prefailure to postfailure shoreline was approximately  feet the estimated volume of failed bank material above the waterline was approximately  cubic yards hydraulically placed sand was not compacted and was characterized by a high void ratio and correspondingly low bulk density the loose condition of this type of material made it susceptible to a high degree of consolidation under applied loads when consolidation of this material occurred under saturated conditions excess water pressure developed in the void spaces between the individual sand particles the excess pressure forced the sand particles apart and negated the shear strength of the sand until the excess pressure was able to dissipate the loss of shear strength often results in a bank failure particularly under a sustained load the load applied to the bank by the victims loader and the supported section of pipeline caused the failure this load caused the loose hydraulicallyplaced sand to consolidate extending into the shallow zone of saturated sand the maneuvering of the loader likely created a zone of excess pressure that resulted in a loss of shear strength causing the bank to fail under the sustained load frontend loader and pipeline the frontend loader involved in the accident was a komatsu model wal approximately  feet high  feet long and  feet wide with a wheelbase approximately  feet long the contact area per tire was approximately four square feet the weight of the loader was approximately  pounds the section of pipe being transported by the loader was an foot long segment of inch diameter inch thick steel pipe it was fitted with four foot long inch diameter hollow steel pontoons the weight of the pipe segment and pontoons was approximately  pounds the load applied to the sand bank by the victims loader was equal to weight of the loader plus the weight of the pipe it supported considering that the loader was likely to be supporting half of the weight of the pipe section or  pounds the total load applied to the bank by the victims loader and supported pipeline section was approximately  pounds the average applied load per tire was approximately  pounds and the average applied stress was approximately  pounds per square foot weather the weather on the day of the accident was clear hot and dry and was not considered a factor in the accident personal protective equipment although a lifejacket was provided in the cab of the loader the victim was not wearing one when recovered training kent l raikes had  years  months mining experience and had received training in accordance with  cfr part  steve boothe had  years mining experience and had received training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following root cause was identified root cause the procedures failed to adequately address the risks associated with work performed near the dredge pond mining methods did not ensure that the stability of material could be maintained where persons worked or traveled near the dredge pond the weight of the loader and dredge pipe exceeded the banks ability to support it corrective action procedures should be established to ensure that persons can work safely near the dredge pond the stability of tailing deposits should be determined before persons travel or work in these areas these procedures should be posted and discussed with all persons working at the dredge pond conclusion the accident occurred because the procedures failed to adequately address the risks associated with work performed near the dredge pond the mining methods used did not ensure that slope stability could be maintained in places where persons worked or

handrail or midrail along the walkway disconnecting a temporary air line located seven feet above the walking surface the accident occurred because safe work procedures were not utilized to protect persons working at an elevated location the victim was working without fall protection where there was a danger of falling general information texaslehigh cement plant quarry a crushed limestone operation and cement plant owned and operated by texas lehigh cement company lp was located approximately two miles south of buda hays county texas the principal operating official was robert kidnew president the mine operated two hour shifts a day seven days per week total employment was  persons limestone was drilled and blasted utilizing a multiple bench mining method broken rock was fed into a primary crusher and conveyed to the plant where it was mixed with other materials to produce cement finished products were shipped to customers by rail cars and trucks the last regular inspection at this operation was completed on november   description of the accident on september   jonathan dowdy victim reported for work at  am his normal starting time was  am but he came in early that day to check the plant waste water system a normal job duty dowdy finished checking the waste water system about  am when he and michael brown welderrepairman were assigned by joe bustamante maintenance foreman to finish a job they had started together earlier in the week two days prior to the accident bustamante assigned dowdy and brown the project of upgrading the air cannon system for the kiln in preparation they installed a temporary air line inch outer diameter hose to bypass the permanent air line that supplied the air cannon brown who was a few inches taller than the  dowdy stood on the inclined walkway near the end of the kiln to install a tee in the permanent air line brown added an inline ball valve before he and dowdy routed the hose from the ground level compressor station to the newly installed valve brown stood on the walkway and connected the hose using a quick coupling and safety pins both dowdy and brown were then assigned to other tasks until the day of the accident upon resumption of the air cannon upgrade dowdy and brown used the temporary air line while performing some work on the permanent air line they finished about  am and briefly discussed what to do next they agreed to close the valve at the elevated end of the hose bleed the pressure off the hose and disconnect the compressor end of the hose dowdy and brown decided to leave the elevated end of the hose connected in case they needed it later dowdy went to the inclined walkway to close the valve between the permanent air line and the hose and arrived there about  am dowdy closed the valve and signaled to brown that he had done so brown could see from his vantage point at ground level that the valve handle was in the off position and that the elevated end of the hose was still attached brown then walked to the air compressor station which was a few feet away and outofsight from the inclined walkway he opened the valve to the permanent air line and closed the valve to the hose moises ramirez production helper came by and assisted brown in bleeding the pressure from the hose and removing it from the compressor connection about  am ramirez left the air compressor station to check a dust dumpster that was located at ground level below the inclined walkway where dowdy had been standing ramirez found dowdy lying on his left side next to the dumpster dowdy was not wearing fall protection and fell from the walkway hit the west edge of the dust dumpster and landed on the concrete floor next to the dumpster ramirez called for help and several employees came to the scene dowdy was given cardiopulmonary resuscitation until local emergency medical personnel arrived he was pronounced dead at the scene by the justice of the peace death was attributed to blunt force trauma investigation of the accident msha was notified of the accident at  am on september   by a telephone call from scott garraway safety and training director to ralph rodriguez supervisory mine safety and health inspector an investigation was started that day an order was issued under the provisions of section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners mshas accident investigation team traveled to the mine made a physical inspection of the accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and employees discussion location of the accident the accident occurred on an inclined walkway near the kiln in the plant the plant was roofed and open to the outside the weather was clear skies with a temperature of approximately  degrees fahrenheit inclined walkway the inclined walkway was parallel to the east side of the kiln between pier  and the feed end the walkway was  feet long  inches wide and rose  feet from the kiln feed to pier  at a  slope the walkway ranged from  feet to  feet above the concrete floor at ground level the walkway surface was clean constructed of solid antiskid metal structurally sound and had adequate traction the walkway was equipped on each side with inch inner diameter tubular metal midrails and handrails the midrails were  inches high and the handrails were  inches high both measured from the walking surface air supply system compressed air was supplied to the air cannon system from an atlas copco model ga air compressor located on the ground level of the plant the compressor also supplied air to several dryers air receivers valves and rigid pipes the compressed air system was checked and found to be in working condition normal operating pressure for the system was  pounds per square inch and no pressure buildup was detected the permanent main air line consisted of inch schedule  metal piping and was routed from the air compressor station on the ground level to the south end of the inclined walkway near the feed end of the kiln just outside the west handrail there were three ball valves installed in this area the valves were inspected and found to be without defects the first ball valve served the upper air cannons and was located  feet above the walking surface and  foot from the south end of the walkway this valve was in the off position a lock and outofservice tag had been installed on this valve prior to the accident because of an unrelated maintenance project the second valve served the automatic greasing system for the kiln drive gear and was located  feet above the walking surface this valve was in the on position but was unrelated to the accident the third valve was a dixon inline ball valve that had been installed by brown only two days before the accident it connected to the main line through a pipe tee and had a lug air king end quick coupling on the other side to accommodate an air hose similarly equipped the valve was  feet above the walking surface and  feet from the south end of the walkway the air king end was  feet above the walking surface and  feet from the south end of the walkway temporary air line the temporary air line consisted of two  foot long inch inner diameter flexible rubber hoses that were connected end to end all hose ends were equipped with lug air king ends quick couplings that were secured with safety pins the hose was routed from the ground level air compressor station up to the north end of the inclined walkway then outside the west side of the walkway to the recently installed valve and tee from the permanent air line the air hose had been disconnected at the coupling and was hanging over the handrail at the west side of the walkway above where dowdy was found training and experience jonathan g dowdy had seven and a half years of mining experience and had received training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following causal factors were identified causal factor administrative controls needed improvement in that a risk assessment was not conducted prior to installing the air valve for the temporary air line seven feet above the walkway equipped with hand rails that was inclined at a  degree slope the victim may not have recognized the hazard associated with reaching above the hand rails to uncouple the air hose the victim was working where there was a danger of falling and was not secured by a safety belt and line corrective action conduct a risk assessment to identify all potential hazards and ensure valves and controls are positioned where persons operating them are not exposed to hazards thoroughly train employees in safe job procedures and hazard recognition before any work begins conclusion the accident occurred because safe work procedures were not utilized to protect persons working while positioned at an elevated location the victim was working where there was a danger of falling and was not secured by a safety belt and line a risk assessment to identify all possible hazards and establish safe procedures had not been conducted by management or the worker prior to performing this task enforcement actions order no  was issued on september   under provisions of section k of the mine act a fatal accident

was fatally injured and jonathan r day drillerbreaker age  was seriously injured on april   when they were crushed under a limestone slab strunk and day were drilling an uneven area of the quarry floor at the base of a limestone block that had been cut from the bench subsequent movement of the limestone block caused a cracked section to fracture and fall on top of both men the accident occurred because management failed to conduct adequate examinations of equipment to ensure defects that affect miners safety were recognized and the equipment was repaired or removed from service the failure to take down or support the hazardous ground conditions that were visible on the limestone block contributed to the accident general information maple hill quarry a surface dimension limestone quarry operated by bg hoadley quarries inc was located in bloomington monroe county indiana the principal operating officials were mrs patsy fellbaker chief executive officer and david r fell president the mine normally operated one hour shift per day five days a week total employment was  persons at the time of the accident limestone was being removed from the uppermost bench in the quarry the limestone was cut vertically by diamond belt saws cuts were  feet long channel cuts by  feet wide headline by  feet deep the resulting limestone pillars were broken from the limestone formation by inserting and then inflating air bladders into the channel cuts causing the bottom line of the pillar to break the resulting limestone blocks were then turned on their sides with the aid of a frontend loader blocks were cut into sections by drilling a line of holes with handheld pneumatic drills and then manually breaking the block into sections with slipsandwedges cut sections were removed from the quarry by frontend loader to a staging area the quarried limestone was transported from the mine by a flatbed trailer the limestone blocks were sold to dimension limestone finishing facilities where they were cut up and finished into numerous products the last regular inspection at this operation was completed on november   description of accident on the day of the accident benjamin o strunk victim drillerbreaker reported for work at  am his usual starting time and was assigned to the quarry crew the quarry crew consisted of four persons and was responsible for breaking the pillars from the limestone formation turning the limestone blocks on their sides and then manually cutting the turned limestone blocks into usable sections shortly after the beginning of the shift nathan martin drillerbreaker was working on the upper ledge preparing a limestone block to be turned on its side martin placed an inflatable bladder in the channel cut and inflated the bladder to expand the cut to a width that would allow him to insert a pair of inflatable bladders after inserting the bladder pair martin deflated the single bladder by turning the control ballvalve to the off position and disconnecting the quick disconnect from the bladders allowing the limestone block to move back into a resting position pinching the two bladders in place martin secured the bladders and attached the air hoses to the bladders in preparation for turning the limestone block martin then returned to the quarry floor and assisted the quarry crew with the cuttingup of turned limestone blocks after conducting preparation duties for the days work the quarry crew turned a limestone block on its side and cut it into smaller pieces they began the process of cutting a second block strunk and day cut a section off the eastern edge of the second block then relocated to the area at the toe of the next vertical limestone block during the time that the quarry crew had been performing their duties the two inflatable bladders that had been set in place earlier that day were slowly inflating the incidental inflation of the bladders was caused by a defective ballvalve allowing air to leak through the closed valve strunk and day had moved to the toe area so they could remove an uneven section of the quarry floor see appendix b the section that they were attempting to remove was the bottom of a limestone pillar that had broken unevenly from the formation strunk had shoveled loose material away from the uneven area and began drilling horizontal holes along the bottom line while day was in the area placing slipsandwedges at approximately  am a slab of limestone fractured from the block due to the incidental inflation of the bladders left in the channel cut and fell on both men emergency personnel were called at  am by john a miller safety coordinator prior to the arrival of emergency personnel john wheeler frontend loader operator lifted a portion of the slab off day so martin and charlie cain drillerbreaker could extract him at this time the miners realized that strunk was also under the limestone slab they had originally thought that strunk was working on the upper ledge emergency personnel arrived at the scene at  am and extracted strunk strunk was pronounced dead at the scene at  am by the monroe county coroner the cause of death was attributed to blunt force trauma day was transported to the hospital with extensive injuries investigation of the accident msha was notified at  am on april   by a telephone call from david r fell president to gene w upton supervisory mine safety and health inspector an investigation began on the same day an order was issued pursuant to section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners mshas accident investigation team conducted a physical inspection of the accident site interviewed employees and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and employees location of the accident the accident occurred at the toe of the west end of the eastern row of limestone blocks see appendix b ground conditions the limestone slab measured  feet long  feet high and  inches thick with an estimated volume of  cubic feet using a limestone density of  pounds per cubic foot the slab weighed approximately  pounds it had fractured off from the limestone block along a joint that ran north  degrees east this joint pattern was prevalent throughout the entire limestone formation this same joint ran through the previous block that had split and was turned on its side in two pieces weather conditions weather conditions were overcast with dissipating fog a temperature of approximately  degrees fahrenheit and a calm wind weather was not considered a factor in the accident geologic conditions observations conducted of the geologic structure of the limestone indicated that joints with an orientation and inclination similar to the joint that bounded the fallen slab were present throughout the limestone formation being mined the joint pattern observed during this investigation was considered a factor in the occurrence of this accident air lifting bag system inflatable bladders the inflatable bladder system was a maxi force air lifting bag system manufactured by paratech incorporated frankfort illinois the system as used by hoadley quarries was comprised of an air source company compressor controller with safety inline relief valve lifting bags and interconnecting hoses bags were ply reinforced kevlar neoprene covered bladders and were tested to  psig the system was designed to operate at  psig controller relief valves were variable with a maximum relief pressure of  psig the design of the air lifting system was not considered a factor in the accident however the incidental pressurization of the system due to the defective ballvalve was found to be one of the primary contributing factors to the occurrence of this accident ballvalve the ballvalve was manufactured by toyo valve company tokyo japan redwhite valve corporation who owns rights to toyo brand in the united states confirmed that the maximum compressed air rating would be at least the valves  psig working steam pressure rating the ballvalve was designed and rated for use with water oil and gas operations at ambient temperatures of  degrees to  degrees fahrenheit the defective ballvalve was one of four found on the downstream side of the oiler used to turn the flow of compressed air onandoff to the pneumatic equipment used by the quarry crew the ballvalve as manufactured was not considered to be a contributing factor to the occurrence of this accident however the ballvalve was found to be defective because it would allow a small volume of compressed air to pass through it when the valve was in the off position this defect was considered one of the primary factors that contributed to the occurrence of this accident medical analysis and findings a sample of the victims blood was analyzed for alcohol and controlled substances by an independent laboratory the active form of cannabinoid was determined to be  nanogramsml these levels indicate recent use of marijuana although impairment could not be ruled out it was not determined to be a contributory factor in the accident training and experience benjamin o strunk had  weeks of mining experience all at this mine he had received training in accordance with  cfr part  and was performing his regular duties at the time of the accident root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following root causes were identified root cause management policies and controls were inadequate procedures were not in place to require that hazardous ground conditions be taken down or supported before work or travel commenced corrective action management should establish formalized policies and procedures that require ground conditions that may pose a hazard to miners be controlled all miners should be trained to examine recognize and control ground conditions that may pose a hazard root cause management failed to formalize policies and procedures that would require thorough examinations of air control valves to identify defects the defective air control valve was not removed from service corrective action management should establish formalized policies and procedures that would require equipment be examined prior to use and defective equipment be either repaired or tagged out and removed from service to ensure that it is not used until repairs are made conclusion the accident occurred because management failed to establish procedures that required the defective air control valve to be either repaired replaced or removed from service the defect allowed the bladders placed in the channel cut to inflate management failed to establish procedures requiring that hazardous ground conditions be taken down or supported before other work or travel was permitted in the affected area no action was taken to ensure that the hazardous ground condition was taken down or warnings posted to prevent access to the area prior to the accident enforcement actions order no  was issued on april   under section k of the mine act a fatal accident occurred at this operation on april   when a miner was drilling holes for wedges at the base of the ledge in the pit area this order is issued to assure the safety of all persons at this operation it prohibits all activity at the ledge area in the pit until msha has determined that it is safe to resume normal mining operations in the area the mine operator shall obtain prior approval from an authorized representative for all actions to recover andor restore operations to the affected area the order was terminated on april   after the conditions that contributed to the accident no longer existed citation no  was issued on may   under provisions of section a of the mine act for a violation of  cfr  on april   a drillerbreaker was fatally injured at this mine when he was struck by a piece of limestone that fell from a section of highwall that had been cut in preparation for removal the limestone that fell measured approximately  feet long  feet high and  inches thick this hazardous ground condition was visible prior to the fatal accident yet no measures were taken to take down or support this unstable material or to post warnings to prevent access to the area this citation was terminated on june   policies and procedures were established by the mine operator for evaluating ground conditions and implementing corrective action mine employees were provided training in identifying hazardous ground conditions and of the company policy and procedures miners have been instructed that hazards must be immediately reported to the ledge foreman and that miners must be removed from the affected areas the mine operator has also obtained an excavator and hydraulic hammer attachment so miners can remove loose ground safely citation no  was issued on may   under provisions of section a of the mine act for a violation of  cfr c on april   a drillerbreaker was fatally injured at this mine when he was struck by a piece of limestone that fell from a section of highwall that had been cut in preparation for removal the limestone that fell measured approximately  feet long  feet high and  inches thick inflatable bladders that were used to break the block from the surrounding ground were put in place behind the cut section an air hose that provided compressed air to the bladders was connected and the air shut off valve was in the off position the air shut off valve was defective allowing air to pressurize the inflatable bladders this resulted in moving the limestone block which in turn caused the piece of limestone to fall this defective valve was not repaired or taken out of service this citation was terminated on june   the defective valve has been taken out of service policies and procedures were enacted by the mine operator to ensure that the equipment used with inflatable bladders

on a mechanics creeper under his truck trying to replace the left side axle pivot bolt on the trucks axle the accident occurred because the owner of the truck failed to follow the manufacturers procedures to complete the repair the truck was not blocked against movement and drifted backward on a slight grade causing a jack and wooden block to kick out the victim was a sole proprietor of an independent trucking company whose trucks regularly hauled finished products from stock piles on the mine site to offsite customers neither fuentesdeleon nor abm trucking llc was employed by or contracted by the mine operator to perform any work or service at the mine the federal register dated september   included mandatory regulations related to training and retraining of miners at surface crushed stone mines such as chantilly crushed stone inc the definition of miner as stated in  cfr g excludes customers and commercial overtheroad truck drivers general information chantilly crushed stone incorporated mine a trap rock operation owned and operated by chantilly crushed stone inc chantilly was located in chantilly loudon county virginia the principal operating official was john gudelsky president the mine operated one hour shift five days per week total employment was  persons trap rock was blasted from multiple benches and transported to the crushing plant by frontend loaders haul trucks and conveyors where it was broken and separated into various sized materials finished products were sold as construction aggregate the majority of deliveries to offsite customers were transported by overtheroad haul trucks owned and operated by  trucking a subsidiary of chantilly the  trucking repair garage was located on mine property to meet increased demand the company also used independent truckers to make deliveries to customers abm trucking llc abm a sole proprietor independent trucking company was located in manassas prince william county virginia the principal operating official was julio fuentesdeleon victim abm owned four haul trucks that were used on a regular basis to haul stone from chantilly to its customers abm had no formal contract with chantilly and based on demand had been known to leave this property and haul stone from other mine sites fuentesdeleon did not work at chantilly and did not perform any activity on the mine site for frequent or extended periods his trucks were exclusively involved in hauling processed materials from stockpiles to offsite customers the mine operator had no knowledge that the victim was attempting to replace the lift axle bolt on his truck on the day of the accident all four abm trucks were parked at the mine in a staging area provided by chantilly the independent truck staging area was located near the entrance to the mine site near the mines scale house at the time of the accident  independently owned trucks were parked in this area based on customer demand the scale house dispatcher assigned off site deliveries of crushed stone to the independent truckers on a firstcomefirstserve basis the last regular inspection of the mine was completed on january   description of accident on the morning of the accident inclement weather conditions created a slow business day the four abm drivers were gathered with numerous other drivers in the independent truckers trailer located in the staging area fuentesdeleon arrived about  am to work on haul truck # which was empty and parked between other trucks in the staging area at  pm eric o moran truck driver for aquia trucking was going into the scale house to get a trip ticket and observed fuentesdeleon walk around the truck carrying tools about  pm edmundo tomas torres driver of truck # went to the truck to see if fuentesdeleon had completed repairs when torres arrived he found fuentesdeleon pinned and unresponsive under the trucks lift axle torres ran to the scale house to get help a call was made for emergency medical assistance rick hoffman mine superintendent went directly to the scene to lend assistance and found that fuentesdeleon had been pulled from under the truck and was lying on a mechanics creeper at  pm the victim was pronounced dead at the scene by the responding emergency medical personnel the cause of death was attributed to crushing injuries there were no witnesses to the accident chantilly had a written policy prohibiting major truck repairs by independent truckers on mine property reportedly fuentesdeleon had attempted to make the same repair two days earlier but had brought the wrong diameter bolt to the staging area investigation of accident the mine safety and health administration msha was notified of the accident at  pm on february   by a telephone call from steven herzberg safety director to the national call center joseph denk acting assistant district manager was called and an investigation was started the same day an order was issued under the provisions of k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners mshas accident investigation team traveled to the mine made a physical inspection of the accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and employees inspectors from the virginia department of mines minerals and energy and independent truckers discussion location of the accident the accident occurred on mine property at an area located about  feet west of the scale house chantilly permitted independent truck drivers to park their trucks overnight in this location weather on the day of the accident the weather was cloudy and cold with intermittent periods of sleet and snow equipment the truck involved in the accident was an overtheroad  western star model f haul truck equipped with a steering axle two rear tandem drive axles and four watson chalin sltt series lift axles it was powered by a turbocharged caterpillar model c  horsepower diesel engine through an eighteen speed eatonfuller transmission the truck was equipped with a phase ii truck body the outside dimensions of the container were  feet wide  feet  inches high and  feet  inches long brake system the service brakes were applied by pushing a foot pedal in the cab the service brake system consisted of an airoperated twoshoe internalexpanding drum type arrangement at each wheel the steering axle and the lift axle brake chambers were all singlecompartment chambers which provided only service braking capability each drive axle brake chamber was a dualcompartment chamber the forward compartment provided service braking capability and the rear compartment provided parking brake capability the parking brakes could be applied manually with the pushpull parking brake valve in the operators cab or automatically from loss of air system pressure tests conducted during the investigation showed the air system leakage rate did not exceed the manufacturers allowable air leakage rates and no audible air leaks were found when the rear tandem tires were firmly on the ground the parking brake had the capability to hold the empty truck after the accident the empty truck was found with the center two lift axles down and the other two lift axles up this condition was duplicated during testing and investigators determined that the rear tandem drive axles lifted from the ground even though it was applied the parking brake system was ineffective because only the rear tandem axles had parking brake capability axle design the rear tandem drive axle assembly was equipped with a high density solid rubber spring walkingbeam type suspension system the gross axle weight rating gawr of each of the two drive axles was  pounds and the gawr of the steering axle was  pounds the truck was equipped with four watson chalin lift axles located between the steering axle and the rear tandem drive axles the airlift airride lift axles were selfsteering and each one had a gawr of  pounds the selfsteering feature allowed the axles to track the road improved handling and increased tire life three toggle switches in the cab allowed the driver to raise and lower the lift axles the left toggle switch controlled the front lift axle the center toggle switch controlled the center two lift axles and the right side toggle switch controlled the fourth lift axle located in front of the rear tandem drive axles when a toggle switch was moved to the up position the lift spring was pressurized and vented any air in the ride spring to the atmosphere this caused a lift arm to rotate on a pivot bolt and lift the axle off the ground when the toggle switch was placed in the down position air pressure was dumped from the lift spring the ride spring was pressurized and the axle was pushed down against the road pivot bolt replacement procedure a lift arm pivot bolt a huck fastener was originally installed which required specialized tools for installation according to the manufacturer an acceptable replacement would be a grade  fine thread bolt with a lock nut at the time of the accident the victim was driving a inch long inch diameter piece of allthreadrod into the pivot hole to push out the broken huck bolt no specialized tools were found at the accident scene according to the manufacturer the air pressure to the lift spring and ride spring should be completely vented before attempting to replace the pivot bolt following the accident coworkers found the lift axle being repaired in the down position the corresponding toggle switch control for this lift axle was also found in the down position the resultant downward pressure from the ride spring on the axle would have placed a binding load on the pivot bolt summary the center two lift axles on the empty truck were down and the other two lift axles up when this condition was duplicated during testing investigators determined that the rear tandem drive axles lifted from the ground this made the parking brake system ineffective even though it was applied because only the rear tandem axles had parking brake capability no other air system braking or lift axle control system deficiencies were found training and experience julio a fuentesdeleon was a sole proprietor of an independent trucking company whose trucks hauled finished products from stockpiles to offsite customers mshas definition of miner as stipulated in  cfr g does not include overtheroad truck drivers chantilly had provided the victim with sitespecific hazard awareness

attended a meeting with the blasting crew before going underground jon van engan general mine foreman instructed shaw lynne mcarthur and jeramie drobny miners to load and blast panel  between the  level and the  level explosives could not be loaded from the top at the  level because some of the drill holes had caved in therefore the holes had to be loaded from the  lower level shaw used a yard lhd to transport blasting materials from an explosives magazine located on the  level when shaw drove through the  north sill he traveled over backfilled material that had been placed in the stope he and the lhd fell through the floor into a large void that had developed in the backfill mcarthur and drobny were nearby and heard the lhd crashing as it fell they went to the stope and found an opening in the floor approximately  feet wide and  to  feet long and saw a void beneath the opening they could hear the lhds engine but could not see shaw or the machine mcarthur called for emergency assistance and rescue efforts began immediately search and rescue efforts were continuously conducted in coordination with company federal and state mine safety officials the efforts to find and recover shaw were complicated because he and the lhd were engulfed in the collapsed ground the center for robotassisted search and rescue assisted in the efforts to locate the victim sophisticated robotics infrared and night vision cameras were lowered into the void and through  newlydrilled inch diameter holes the location of the lhd was discovered but the victim could not be found hazardous ground conditions in the backfill near the floor opening on the  level prevented persons from safely working at that location a draw point was established at a lower level of the stope the  level at this location persons were working on solid ground a narrow entryway to the draw point and loose material continuously feeding down the stope limited the type and size of equipment that could be used a yard remotecontrolled lhd was small enough to maneuver in the area but the corners of some pillars had to be drilled and shot to improve maneuverability the progress was slow because the lhd buckets could not be filled to capacity due to tight quarters that limited vision material excavated by the lhds was deposited on the ground searched for articles belonging to the victim and then hauled away by larger  yard lhds on june   the yard lhd that the victim had been operating was recovered since the victims exact location could not be pinpointed much more material had to be removed after delays due to equipment breakdowns and material falling into the void from the upper levels of the stope the victim was recovered at the draw point on july   investigation of the accident the mine safety and

accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management employees state of nevada mine safety and training section and the elko county sheriffs office discussion location of the accident the accident occurred in the  north sill drift located in the colorado grande  vein the subsidence occurred on the north sill approximately  feet in from the sill drift access mining and backfill procedure the mine was accessed by a main decline sublevel stoping was used to extract the gold and silver ore from a series of nearvertical narrow veins which were hosted by volcanic rocks the various levels of mining were referenced to feet above mean sea level amsl the working levels in the area of the accident at that time were  and  feet amsl spiral ramps allowed access to the ore veins crosscuts were driven from each spiral to the ore vein at foot vertical increments and then sill drifts were driven in the veins from and roughly perpendicular to the crosscuts in both the north and south directions the sill drifts were advanced by drilling and blasting and averaged about  to  feet wide and  feet high the sill drifts outlined the top and bottom of ore stopes that were generally  feet high foot vertical spacing minus foot sill drift height the stopes were mined from the end of the sill drift by extracting a series of panels typically  feet long and  feet high retreating back toward the stope access crosscut the stope panels were drilled and blasted from the sill drift above with the blasted ore falling to the sill below the ore was then removed from the sill below by remotecontrolled lhds after the ore was mucked out the mined area was backfilled using a combination of cemented rock fill crf and uncemented mine run waste rock crf was used to create a ï¿½plugï¿½ of unspecified thickness at the bottom of the minedout stope and then uncemented waste rock was placed above the crf the percentage of cement in crf mixtures reportedly ranged from  to  the percentages of waste rock cement and water were not measured or controlled and the components were not thoroughly mixed there was no procedure for compacting or consolidating the crf and no strength or other quality testing of the crf was performed after it was mixed wet cfr was transported to the stope by lhd and dumped from the sill above into the minedout stope once a crf ï¿½plugï¿½ was in place lhds dumped uncemented waste rock on top of the crf into the minedout stope there was no procedure for compacting or consolidating the waste rock fill after each foot high panel was extracted and backfilled the backfilled upper sill drift became the bottom sill drift for subsequent upwardadvancing stope work at the accident location a crf plug was placed at the lowest sill drift level  backfill placed in the stope above the plug did not contain any cement ore zones left in place below the levels previously mined were mined later using a different method in the area of the accident an open top sill drift no longer existed at the  level so sills were driven at the  level and blast holes were drilled upwards from the lower sill drift into the panel stope the shot panel was mucked by remotecontrolled lhds from the  level mining in this manner created a void that could not be backfilled from above these areas approximately  feet high and extending up to the bottom of the  crf plug were left unfilled and therefore remained open voids hence they were referred to as ï¿½open uppers the crf plugs above were not supported from beneath and relied solely on the binding strength of the cement to hold the plugs and the uncemented waste rock above them in place if the crf failed for any reason the uncemented waste rock fill above could drop down into the open stope below leaving a void in the backfilled stope above and permitting subsidence to occur subsidence had been previously observed in several locations in the mine including the areas below the  north sills where the accident occurred drilling and blasting of the panels between the  and  levels was performed from the  level with the exception of panel  the panel in which the drill holes had caved and which was to be loaded from below the  north sill that had once been closed for safety concerns was traveled by lhds mucking ore that had been shot down from the panels above this area was used for travel on the day of the accident to transport blasting materials to panel  for several days prior to the accident subsidence at the  north sill was filled with material placed by lhds three days prior to the accident approximately  gallons of water disappeared suddenly from a low spot in the drift in the vicinity of the accident area the need to repeatedly fill the subsidence and the sudden disappearance of the water indicated that voids existed in the backfill loader the lhd involved in the accident was a sandvik yard lhd model no ejc  the loader was equipped with rubber tires and a falling object protection structure fops over the operators compartment it was powered by a diesel engine that drove a hydraulic pump to operate the unit training and experience thomas d shaw had  years and  weeks mining experience all at this mine he had received training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following causal factor was identified causal factor management policies and procedures failed to ensure that the combination of mining methods and ground control measures employed were adequate to protect persons and safely support equipment controls were not in place to ensure the quality of the procedures and materials used in the backfill process permitting voids to be created in the backfill the inadequate backfill was used for ground support and travelways creating hazards to persons working or traveling in these areas there were no procedures to report voids found in the backfill material corrective action management should establish procedures to ensure that the quality amount and placement of backfill to prevent voids from occurring during the backfill process procedures should be established to ensure that backfill material is of adequate strength and properly installed to prevent voids and to safely support persons and equipment procedures should be established for persons to report voids that are suspected or found so these hazards can be corrected conclusion the accident occurred because management failed to establish procedures to ensure that safe ground conditions were established and maintained materials used for backfill were not tested the backfill placement left voids creating hazards for miners working and traveling in the areas management was aware that voids developed in the backfill in the area of the accident management had investigated these occurrences but still required persons to travel and work in this area without addressing the hazards no warning signs or barricades were placed in these areas to notify persons of the hazards that were identified enforcement actions order no  was issued on july   under the provisions of section k of the mine act an accident occurred at

the hazards and conditions which contributed to the fatal accident were identified and addressed the operator had established and was following a plan to prevent miners from being exposed to similar hazards and conditions in other areas of the mine therefore order number  was terminated order no  was issued on july   under provisions of section d of the mine act for violation of  cfr  a fatal accident occurred at this operation on june   when a frontend loader being operated by a miner fell into a major subsidence sinkhole on the  level of the mine engulfing the loader and operator a ground control system was not designed installed and maintained to control the ground in this area the employees accessed this area on foot and in mobile equipment prior to the accident the company

overview on september   david a rogers truck driver age  was fatally injured when the ton haul truck he was operating overturned rogers was preparing to dump a load of rock over the edge of the foot high truck dump site when a portion of the dump site failed the collapse caused the truck to overturn and land on its roof the accident occurred because policies standards and controls were not in place to ensure that a berm or similar impeding device was maintained at the dump site management failed to visually inspect the dump location to identify signs of possible unstable ground conditions before directing trucks to dump the victim was not wearing a seat belt which contributed to the severity of his injuries general information west pittsburg quarry a surface limestone operation owned

mine normally operated two hour shifts  days a week total employment was  persons limestone was drilled and blasted from a single bench in the pit the broken limestone was loaded into haul trucks by an excavator and transported to a raw material stockpile the material was then processed through the plant where it was crushed screened and stockpiled the finished products were sold for use in the construction industry the last regular inspection at this operation was completed on august   description of accident on the day of the accident david a rogers victim reported for work at his normal starting time of  am rogers and rodney e thompson truck drivers were assigned to haul shot rock from the quarry to the truck dump site at approximately  am thompson hauled and dumped the first load of shot rock at an area of the dump site that was bermed rogers followed with the second load and the two drivers alternated dumping in this area when rogers hauled his third load to the dump site he backed his truck to the northwest side where the berm had been loaded out by the evening shift the edge of the dump site failed causing the truck to overturn peter jaskola frontendloader operator was sent to the primary stockpile to check conditions at the top of the dump site while driving past the bottom of the pile he noticed the overturned truck and began blowing the loaders horn to summon

investigation of the accident msha was notified of the accident at  am on september   by a telephone call from doug ordak to james r petrie district manager ordak was the safety director of a nearby quality aggregates facility and was contacted by newgate management to assist at the scene an investigation was started the same day an order was issued under the provisions of section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners mshas accident investigation team traveled to the mine conducted a physical inspection at the accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and employees the pennsylvania department of environmental protection and the lawrence county coroners office discussion location of the accident the accident occurred at the truck dump site located near the crushing and screening plant trucks dumped material from the edge of the permanent dump site to form a stockpile of raw material the dump site had a gentle arc shape with more pronounced curvature at the south end at the location of the accident the dump site was  feet high and  feet wide the surface of the dump site sloped away from the edge at an average grade of  percent however at the accident location the surface sloped away from the edge at  percent a partial berm between  and  inches high existed along the edge of the dump site south of the accident location however there was no evidence that a berm existed at the location of the accident for an overview of the accident scene please refer to figure  the dump site was constructed of fill material over top of natural ground to create the elevated work area the fill material consisted of gravel and cobblesized stone with an occasional rock of about  inches in a matrix of sandy soil the quarry was idle for nine days prior to the accident during this time the stockpiled material at the base of the dump site was depleted material comprising the dump site was also loaded out which resulted in oversteepening of the slope and the berm being removed in the area of the accident along the edge of the slope immediately adjacent to where the accident occurred a small ledge of material still existed this material projected laterally approximately  feet out from the edge and had a height of about  feet the slope of this material was oversteepened to about  degrees due to loadout operations at the toe of the dump area oversteepening of the slope resulted in a lowered resistance to failure figure  the oversteepened ledge of material appeared to have continued through the area where the accident occurred this ledge of material was relatively weak and it failed when the rear tires of the truck backed to this area various cross sections measured at the dump site had overall slope angles ranging from  to  degrees with the upper portions of the slope generally steeper the upper portion of the slope above the material dumped by thompson showed a slope of  degrees the material comprising the dump site had been compacted over time due to truck traffic and contained a significant portion of gravel and sand the fine fraction of the material appeared to be nonplastic therefore the material was classified as cohesionless meaning that the internal strength of the material was mainly attributed to confinement and friction however negative pore water pressures within the fine fraction of the soil created matrix suction forces that gave the soil an apparent cohesive strength the inclusion of this cohesive strength and confinement from compaction permitted the slopes of the dump site to temporarily maintain an angle greater than the angle of repose slope stability analyses were performed to verify the failure scenario a frictional strength of  degrees was selected based on the gradation of the material comprising the ledge and the compaction history this scenario showed that an apparent cohesive strength of approximately  pounds per square foot psf was required to maintain slope stability with a rear wheel loading of  pounds applied at the crest this rear wheel loading occurred at the maximum gross vehicle weight of  pounds it is unlikely that the material in the ledge possessed the  psf of apparent cohesive strength required to maintain stability tension cracks parallel to the crest were observed in the remaining ledge just south of the failure at a distance  feet back from the edge the scarp remaining following the failure of the material in the accident area was nearly vertical a sharp edge existed at the intersection of the scarp and the crown indicating the failure of the ledge as the rear of the truck dropped the downward and lateral momentum caused it to tip and flip over onto the cab a crease in the slope material was observed where the tail of the bed impacted the slope of the dump equipment the truck involved in the accident was a  caterpillar model b ton haul truck with a  pounds maximum gross vehicle weight it was equipped with a dump bed a cat  diesel engine with a flywheel horsepower rating of  horsepower at  revolutions per minute rpm and a  speed automatic transmission with an electronic shift according to information provided by caterpillar  percent of the loaded weight of the truck was carried on the rear axle when loaded to the maximum weight capacity the weight on the rear tires was  pounds the hydraulic hoist system of the truck was visually inspected and tested the hoist cylinders position was at full retraction discounting a minor displacement due to frame and dump body twisting all associated hydraulic lines were visually intact after the engine was started the hoist controls were tested and found to be functional the transmission selector lever was found in the st gear position the position of the transmissions rotary selector spool the actual position of the transmission was found in the reverse position the transmission selector was cycled through reverse neutral and first gear positions with the engine running the transmission directionally changed gears when tested and no problems were identified with the shifting of the actual transmission from reverse to neutral or reverse to forward the transmission control system also had a neutralizer feature that was operated by a switch on the hoist control linkage the transmission would automatically neutralize if the hoist lever was moved to raise position and the transmission was in reverse gear the neutralizer feature functioned when tested because it neutralized the transmission when the hoist control lever was moved to the full raise position the transmission selector spool was in the reverse position indicating that the victim hadnt started to dump the load when the truck went over the dump point mud was observed splashed on both of the convex mirrors surfaces the off side convex mirror and the drivers side convex mirror would have been difficult to use in this condition however the  inch by  inch width x height flat mirror on the drivers side was useable a functional sae j seat belt was present in the operators seating position however the victim had not been wearing the seatbelt at the time of the accident there were no problems identified with the engine control systems the braking and steering systems or the transmission control system that would have restricted the ability of the driver to control the truck at the time of the accident weather the accident occurred at approximately  am in daylight the sky was clear with a temperature of  degrees fahrenheit and no wind the sun was not a factor in the accident training and experience rogers had  years of mining experience and had worked  year  weeks at this mine he had received training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was performed and the following causal factors were identified causal factor policies standards and controls were inadequate and failed to ensure that berms or similar impeding device were maintained at the dump site corrective action procedures should be established that require berms or similar impeding devices at the dump site to be maintained to prevent overtravel and to ensure that equipment is positioned at a safe distance from the edge of the slope causal factor procedures were not in place to ensure that the dump site was inspected for hazards before a haul truck dumped the first load material had been loaded from the stockpile directly below the dump locations which steepened the slope angle and reduced the stability corrective action procedures should be established to ensure that dumping locations are visually inspected prior to dumping the first load on every shift frequent inspections during the work shift should be performed for signs of slope instability the top of the dump area should be examined for cracks unstable ground and sunken or soft areas the load out area should be examined for signs of undercutting and oversteepening of the slope employees should be trained to stop look analyze and manage slam each task to evaluate hazards and ensure steps are taken to safely perform tasks causal factor procedures were not in place to ensure that the provided seat belts were worn when persons operated mobile equipment corrective action procedures should be established that require management to regularly check equipment operators to ensure seat belts are being worn conclusion the accident occurred because policies standards and controls were not in place to ensure that a berm or similar impeding device was maintained at the dump site the dumping location was not visually inspected to identify signs of possible unstable ground conditions prior to directing trucks to dump the victim was not wearing a seat belt which contributed to the severity of his injuries enforcement actions order no  was issued on

strip operator went to the wet mill strip circuit at the autoclave and started work about  am they noticed that the strip sump pump was not pumping at full capacity causing the water to rise on the ground floor of the autoclave wet mill strip area kelly howard relief foreman and two mechanics came took the discharge line apart found a piece of rubber lodged in the line and removed it however removing the obstruction did not correct the problem about  pm the mechanics left to get a spare pump ready so the pump could be changed out howard returned to the office since willkie and fagg both had experience pulling the pump they decided to remove it for the mechanics with the pump lines and the electrical system locked out and unplugged willkie worked from the ground floor sump while fagg remained on the second floor operating the hoist using the hoist they removed the floor cover located above the sump and set it on the floor next to the filter press they then hoisted the pump out of the sump when this was completed willkie went to the second floor and helped fagg lay down the pump on the floor howard then called willkie on his hand held radio and asked him to call back using the telephone willkie called howard and told him they pulled the pump and placed it on the second level floor howard told willkie that the mechanics would be there shortly to install the new pump fagg could not see willkie because he was facing away from the floor opening fagg turned around did not see willkie and immediately approached the floor opening he saw willkie partially lying on the pump

facility the principal operating official was carole beesley plant manager the mine operated three hour shifts a day seven days a week total employment was  persons stone was mined from multiple benches and hauled to the crushing plant where it was crushed sized and conveyed to the milling facility the last regular inspection of this operation was completed on january   description of accident on the day of the accident federico g andrade victim reported for work at his normal starting time of  pm along with mechanics angel capilla and leonard markevicz larry cannady supervisor gave them a work order to change the screens on the diester screening plant at the crude crusher area cannady informed them that paul murillo department helper was preparing the screens and would position them with a forklift when they were ready capilla went to get respirators for the installation work while markevicz and andrade removed the old screens from the diester screen when capilla return to the screening plant richard snell crusher supervisor was on the work platform talking with a laborer who had been cleaning it off snell left the diester screen area murillo operated the fork lift under markeviczs directions and drove the screens to the south side of the diester screen work platform typically this area was used to off load pallets because the hand railing could be removed to afford access to the deck when murillo positioned the forklift and raised the pallet of screens markevicz realized that the material on the work platform prevented them from placing the screens at the normal unloading area markevicz then directed murillo to drive to the north side of the work platform when murillo arrived on the north side he informed the mechanics he was not comfortable lifting the screens to the second level on that side at an angle and over the conveyor because he had never done it before after some discussion markevicz told murillo that he would come down and position the forklift because he had done it several times in the past murillo then went to tell the supervisor that since he was not comfortable lifting the screens in that location markevicz would run the forklift capilla and andrade were on the work platform working on the diester screen while markevicz was operating the forklift when the screens were first lifted into position andrade told markevicz that the pallet needed to be slid further out on the forks to get them closer to the deck the pallet was lowered slid out and raised up under the direction of andrade with the forklift fully extended vertically the pallet was six inches to low to go over the hand rail capilla unbolted a top section of hand rail to get the forklift closer but the pallet still did not clear the hand rail as markevicz reached down to set the park brake and take the forklift out of gear he heard a loud noise when markevicz looked up andrade and the screens were falling to the ground on the work platform capilla had turned around to get the piece of hand rail to bolt back in place when he also heard a loud noise when he turned around he also saw andrade and the screens fall to the ground capilla called for help while miners in the area lifted the screens off andrade emergency assistance arrived within minutes andrade was taken to a local hospital where he died on may   the cause of death was attributed to an embolism resulting from blunt impact to the torso investigation of the accident msha was notified of the accident at  pm on may   by a telephone call from ellen schieber environmental health safety engineer to karonica glover assistant district manager an investigation began the same day mshas accident investigation team conducted a physical inspection of the accident site interviewed employees inspected equipment involved reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and employees discussion location of the accident the accident occurred on level  of the crude crushing area at the elevated diester screen work platform one end of this elevated work platform was equipped with an electric hoist and a wide gate in the hand railing where the screens were normally lifted onto the platform an old skid with used screens and a build up of rock and sand prevented the pallet from being positioned on the platform in the usual location toyota forklift the forklift used to lift the pallet of screens was a toyota model fdau with a  pound load capacity the forks could be lifted to a height of  inches  feet the pallet and screens were stacked  inches higher than the forks the forklift could not raise the pallet high enough to position the load above the top handrail of the deck the forklift was inspected and found to be free of defects pallet the pallet was constructed with inch by inch top deck boards without bottom deck boards there were inch blocks positioned on each corner of the top deck boards to allow room for the forks to get under the pallet this construction did not provide a method to secure the pallet to the forks a standard pallet is constructed with  inch blocks between a top deck and the bottom deck the opening between the two decks helps secure the pallet to the forks screens the screens being lifted at the diester screening plant were  ï¿½ inches by  ï¿½ inches there were  screens which weighed about  pounds stacked on the pallet and lifted by the forklift diester screen and work platform the top of the hand rail on the diester screen work platform was  feet  inches from ground level the work platform was about  inches wide and  feet long with hand railing installed around the perimeter the top hand rail was at a height of ï¿½ inches above the platform weather conditions weather conditions were clear the temperature outdoors was approximately  degrees fahrenheit and was not considered a factor in the accident training and experience federico g andrade had a total of about  years  months mining experience all at this mine he had not received annual refresher training in accordance with  cfr part  this violation was cited separately and did not contribute to the accident root cause analysis a root cause analysis was performed and the following factors were identified root cause policies and controls were inadequate and management failed to ensure the use of fall protection when persons were positioned where there was a danger of falling there was no discussion between management and the miners to identify possible hazards and establish safe procedures to unload the screens at the elevated work location corrective action management should reinforce its training on fall protection use a written procedure should be established related to changing screens at this location management should consider utilizing an all terrain forklift to position material at elevated locations management should utilize risk assessment jointly with miners to discuss possible hazards and establish safe procedures before beginning maintenance tasks conclusion the accident occurred because safe work procedures were not in use during the screen change and management failed to ensure the use of fall protection when work was performed where there was a danger of falling enforcement actions citation number  was issued on july   under the provisions of section  a of the mine act for a violation of  cfr  on may   a miner was fatally injured at this mine when an elevated load flipped and he fell about  feet to the ground the victim had climbed over a railing and stepped onto the elevated load being positioned by a forklift safety belts and lines were not utilized while work was being performed where there was a danger of falling the citation was terminated on july   when miners were retrained in the use of fall protection and a written procedure was developed for screen changes miners have been trained

victims reported for work at  am their normal starting time they were assigned to install roofing bolts to secure the metal roof of the mill building which was under construction kahle was working on the top portion of the mill roof while bagley was operating a manlift and installing bolts along the mill roofs edges about  pm the end of the work shift bagley positioned the manlift basket at the upper portion of the roof of the mill building where kahle entered the man basket with bagley to be transported to the ground bagley rotated the turntable of the manlift toward the southern end of the mill building until the boom and man basket were clear of the mill roof line as bagley maneuvered the boom the manlift began to topple the man basket hit the side of the mill building below roof line the boom struck the ground both miners were tied off to the basket the cause of death was attributed to blunt force trauma investigation of the accident the mine safety and health administration msha was notified of the accident at  pm on july   by a telephone call from richard martin safety manager alaska gold company the information was reported to john pereza acting assistant district manager an investigation was started on july   when the msha investigators arrived at the mine an order was issued under the provisions of section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners mshas accident investigation team made a physical inspection of the equipment and the accident site they interviewed employees and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management employees and contractor management discussion location of accident the accident occurred on the southwest side of the main mill building that was under construction weather on the day of the accident the airport reported the weather as clear and wind speed as  knots per hour weather was not a contributing factor to the accident equipment the equipment involved in the accident was a jlg model hx aerial man basket manlift the machine had a maximum boom extension of  feet and a maximum boom horizontal reach of  feet the operators man basket man basket was  inches wide by  inches long with a maximum rated weight capacity of  pounds the self propelled manlift consisted of a main body chassis and the main boom the main body turntable was mounted on the chassis and rotated  degrees while the chassis remained stationary the main boom was attached to the turntable and could be positioned from slightly below the horizontal position to an almost vertical position the boom had  multiple stages which allowed it to be telescoped out to a maximum length of  feet the manlift had two operator control consoles the main operator control console was located in the man basket at the end of the boom this control console enabled the manlift operator to start and drive the machine and control the aerial man baskets movements the machine had a second control console located at the rear of the turntable that could be utilized to override the control console in the man basket the controls installed on the turntable were operated from the ground and intended to be used in an emergency to lower the aerial man basket to the ground if the operator in the man basket needed assistance the turnable control console did not have controls to move the chassis a remote control box connected to a control cable was provided to move the machine while standing on the ground jlg axle extension design the jlg was not equipped with outriggers but did have the ability to extend and retract the axles to assist in the side stability and to maneuver the jlg through tight places one hydraulic jack with a flat circular plate footplate attached to the cylinder end was equipped on the center of both the front and rear of the chassis when one of the hydraulic cylinders was extended the tires on that end of the machine were lifted off the ground with the tires off the ground the axle could be extended and pinned in place a set of switches on the front and rear of the chassis controlled the lift and axle extension cylinders the axles were found to be fully extended and pinned jlg load management system design a decal showing the allowable operating envelope of the man basket was placed on both the ground and aerial man basket control consoles these decals showed that the end of the man basket should never be extended more than  feet from the pivot point of the turntable of the jlg the machine had a load management system designed to warn the operator visually and audibly when approaching the edge of the permitted man basket operating envelope and to prevent extending the man basket beyond the maximum radius of  feet from the pivot point of the turntable the load management system had two potentiometers located in a sealed box mounted at the rear of the main boom one potentiometer measured the angle of the boom and the other measured the extension of the boom the extension of the boom was sensed by a multiturn potentiometer driven by means of a cable attached to the telescoping part of the boom the signals from these sensors elevation angle and extension distance were fed into a load radius card which calculated the boom radius and extension these potentiometers provided the electrical system logic circuit with the information needed to determine the location of the man basket after the electrical system determined the location of the man basket this information was relayed to both the ground and man basket control stations a blue light indicated the man basket was within the allowable operating envelope and a red light indicated the man basket was approaching the edge of the allowable operating range if there was a failure in either signal both consoles gave an audible warning the system had an over moment control monitoring system that constantly monitored the circuit cards if any fault in output or input was detected all movements that could affect stability were shut down additionally the turntable was pivoted at one end and was supported with a compression spring at the other end the change of weight on the compression spring caused by the extension of the boom provided a movement that could be detected by the load management system the over movement control system had two independent switches to detect the movement caused by extension of the boom one switch was a mechanical activated switch and the other was a proximity switch the switches were set to detect the movement created when the extension of the boom caused the man basket to be extended to the maximum radius of  feet when the switches detected that the man basket was at the maximum radius the switches sent a signal to the electrical system logic circuit when the electrical system logic circuit received the signal indicating the man basket was at its maximum radius the logic circuit prevented the boom lift from being lowered and telescoped out the disabling of the boom from lowering and telescoping was designed to prevent the operator from extending the man basket to the point that would cause the jlg to tip over jlg load management test procedures a decal located at the ground control station outlined a test to be used to determine if the load management system was operating properly this test was intended by the manufacturer to be part of the daily preoperational checks and was listed in the operators and safety manual the man basket boom must be operational in order to conduct this test before the load management test was started the boom had to be fully retracted and placed in a horizontal position after placing the boom in the test starting position the operator was to extend the boom until it stopped the operator held the test switch on the right side of the control panel during this test if the load management system was operating properly a piece of white tape on the inter boom section became visible on the edge of the main boom section because it was damaged in the accident the man basket boom could not be operated preventing the load management system test from being conducted during the investigation the electrical circuits bulbs and wiring which operated the load management system were inspected and found to be intact and in proper operating condition the dead man foot switch emergency stop device and chassis level bubble were tested and found to be operational jlg boom the boom on the jlg was found to have been extended  feet as measured from the front of the turntable on the chassis to the pivot point of the man basket the only structural damage found to the boom was a fracture at the third stage of the boom jlg machine set up during the accident the jlg tipped over and the jlgs boom came to rest on the roof of the electrical main control building for the mill which had prevented the jlgs chassis from tipping all the way onto its side the manufacturers safety manual for the jlg located at the mine indicated the machine was to be operated on a level solid surface the surface area where the jlg was parked was not level and was made up of loose unconsolidated gravel the front tires had left substantial imprints in the gravel showing where they had been located prior to the accident measurements based on the location of the two front tires at the time of the accident revealed the jlg man basket had been setting on a  percent side slope in an attempt to level the machine two  ï¿½ inch by  ï¿½ inch wooden blocks approximately  feet long had been placed under the right rear tire prior to the accident both blocks were found broken after the manlift tipped over the rear hydraulic cylinder for lifting the rear axle of the jlg for the purpose of extending the axle was found extended below the rear tires the round plate foot plate normally located on the end of the hydraulic cylinder was missing from the end of the cylinder a short piece of metal channel was found that had apparently been used in place of the round plate when the jlg was up righted with a crane the end of the protruding hydraulic cylinder rod extended into the ground the crane was used to raise the jlg and the channel was once again placed under the hydraulic cylinder the weight of the chassis was left on the hydraulic cylinder to determine if the hydraulic cylinder would leak down the rear axle hydraulic lift cylinder supported the load of the jlg for  hours without leaking indicating that the rear hydraulic cylinder was extended at the time of the accident having the weight of the rear of the jlg supported by the hydraulic cylinder rather than being supported on the extended tires as intended by the manufacturer reduced the stability of the machine when the boom was rotated to the right side jlg aerial man basket man basket weight the weight of the items in the man basket and the weight of the victims were estimated to be slightly less than maximum allowable weight of  pounds specified by the manufacturer training and experience the task training for the persons assigned to operate the manlift did not identify the safe operating procedures and limitations of the load management system that was critical to safely operate the manlift craig bagley had  years experience as an iron worker and had worked for the contractor at this mine for  weeks he had received hazard awareness training in accordance with  cfr part  tyler kahle had  weeks experience as an iron worker and had worked for the contractor at this mine for  weeks he had received hazard awareness training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was performed and the following root causes were identified causal factor management policies and procedures were inadequate the task training provided to the persons assigned to operate the jlg hx manlift did not identify the specific safe operating procedures and limitations of the load management system that were critical to safely operate this machinery management failed to ensure the training addressed all safe operating procedures corrective action management should fully task train all persons before assigning them to operate machinery they are not familiar with the training should make persons aware of all safe operating procedures and all safety devices recommended by the manufacturer causal factor management policies procedures and controls were inadequate the manlift was used beyond the design capacity intended by the manufacturer creating a hazard to persons the rear center jack on the manlift was being used as a stabilizer or outrigger and the manlift was not positioned on a solid and level surface during use management failed to conduct an assessment of the risk when they allowed the equipment to be positioned on a surface that was not solid and level corrective action management should ensure the manufacturers criteria for safe operation and limitations are provided to equipment operators understood and followed management should ensure that persons monitor machinery operation to identify possible hazards and initiate action to establish and ensure safe operating procedures are followed conclusion the accident occurred because management policies and procedures were inadequate the manlift was not positioned on solid level ground and the center hydraulic lift cylinder was being utilized improperly task training for persons operating the manlift was incomplete and did not address the load management system provided on the unit enforcement actions alaska mechanical inc order no  was issued on july   under the provisions of section k of the mine act two miners were

overview on april   terry a bigler mechanic age  was fatally injured when a forklift drifted and pinned him against a continuous mining machine the forklift was being used to position and install a motor on the continuous mining machine the accident occurred because the forklifts service brake system was not maintained in a functional condition policies standards and controls were inadequate because examinations of the forklift failed to identify all safety defects the service brakes would not hold the forklift when the engine was turned off general information big island mine and refinery an underground trona operation owned and operated by oci wyoming lp was located off us highway   miles northwest of green river sweetwater county wyoming the principal operating official was tim d morrison site manager the mine normally operated two hour production shifts a day seven days a week maintenance personnel normally worked one hour shift per day five days a week at the time of the accident maintenance personnel were working hour shifts per day total employment was  persons trona was mined using conventional room and pillar mining five sections operated in two seams approximately  feet apart ore was mined using continuous mining machines shuttle cars hauled ore from the continuous mining machines and unloaded ore onto conveyors that transported it to loading pockets at two shafts ore was hoisted to the surface processed at a plant on the mine site and sold for use in the glass industry trona was also used as an ingredient for sodiumbased intermediates

mst on april   by a telephone call from terry adcock safety superintendent to irvin t hooker district manager an investigation was started the same day an order was issued under the provisions of section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners msha accident investigators traveled to the mine made a physical inspection of the accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management miners representatives and employees discussion location of the accident the accident occurred in the underground rebuild shop located in the upper bed east panel  south room  west forklift the forklift was a  eimco c equipped with a set of forks as a front attachment instead of a bucket the forklift was powered by a caterpillar  diesel engine had three speeds in both forward and reverse and had articulated steering the operators compartment was laterally oriented on the left side of the machine immediately behind the articulation area the operator sat on the left side of the machine facing the right side of the machine the forklift had a wheelbase of approximately  feet an overall track width of approximately  feet on both the front and rear axles as measured from outside tread edge to outside tread edge of the tires a canopy height of approximately  feet  inches from the top of the canopy to the ground and an overall length of approximately  feet including forks steering and service brake system the forklift had a hydraulic actuated articulated steering system and a dualcircuit hydraulic brake system one circuit for the frontaxle service brakes and one circuit for the rearaxle service brakes with caliper disc brakes at all four wheels figure no  shows a simplified block diagram of steering and service brake hydraulic system design the steering and brake systems were designed so a common pump provided supply pressure to both systems supply pressure was maintained between  pounds per square inch gage psig when the engine was running through the use of an unloading valve each of the three circuits steering front and rear service brakes had a check valve that isolated the respective circuits in the event of a single component failure in one of the other circuits an accumulator provided reserve pressure to bring the machine to a controlled stop in the event of an engine shut down a one gallon nitrogen charged bladdertype accumulator was used in the steering system and a one quart nitrogen charged bladdertype accumulator was used in each of both the front and rear service brake systems the service manual for the machine stated that the precharge pressure for all three accumulators was  psig hydraulic pressure to the front and rear brake circuits was modulated through pressure reducing valves controlled by the service brake foot pedal each of the three circuits had a pressure gage mounted in the dash board panel so the operator could monitor the respective accumulator hydraulic pressures within the system visual observations and testing indicated that the gage for the front service brake accumulator hydraulic pressure was defective because the needle would only drop down to approximately  psig without any system pressure however the pressure reading of the front service brake gage would reflect the hydraulic pressure readings in this system when pressures were within the   psig range the defect in this gage would not allow verification of the accumulator precharge pressure the steering system was functionally tested and no problems were identified with the steering circuit downstream of the check valve located immediately downstream of the unloading valve the caliper disc brake assemblies at each wheel were visually inspected all four brake calipers were observed to actuate when the foot pedal was cycled with the engine running the approximate brake lining thicknesses are summarized in table no  the manual for the wheel brakes stated that the minimum recommended lining thickness was  inch none of the lining thicknesses were observed to be below the manufacturers recommended thicknesses left side lining thicknesses inches right side lining thicknesses inches front axle   rear axle   table no  approximate brake lining thicknesses the brake rotor thicknesses are summarized in table no  the manual for the wheel brakes stated that the minimum recommended brake rotor thickness was  inches one brake rotor on the left rear wheel brake was measured to be below the manufacturers recommended thickness left side rotor thicknesses inches right side rotor thicknesses inches front axle   rear axle   table no  approximate rotor thicknesses the nitrogen precharge pressures were checked by connecting a gage to the charge valve of each accumulator with the hydraulic system pressures bled to  psig the results are summarized in table no  precharge pressure psig steering system  front brake system  rear brake system  table no  approximate accumulator precharge pressures functional tests conducted on the service brake system and a visual inspection of selected components that were removed identified that the check valve immediately downstream of the unloading valve the check valves for each of the service brake systems and both accumulators for each of the service brakes systems were defective figure no  represents the simplified block diagram of steering and service brake hydraulic system with the defects identified illustrated with a line through the respective defective component blocks the effect of these defects did not allow the forklift to maintain pressure in either of the two service brake circuits once the engine was shut down two significant results were found when the service brakes were tested the operator would not be able to apply the service brakes once the engine was shut down because both service brake circuits would immediately lose pressure also the operator would not be able to continue to hold the machine on the grade in the accident area with the service brakes once the engine was shut down because both circuits would immediately lose total pressure visual inspection of all three check valves indicated that they would not prevent backflow due to missing andor damaged internal components attempts were made to charge the two service brake accumulators after they were removed from the machine but neither of them would hold any significant pressure audible leaks were detected within the bladders of these two accumulators the defective components the check valve immediately downstream of the unloading valve the two service brake check valves and the two service brake accumulators were replaced and the system was retested with the forklift maintained as recommended by the manufacturer the operator would be able to continue to hold the machine with the service brakes applied with the engine shut down hydraulic the filters and screens for the hydraulic system were removed from the machine and visibly inspected and no significant debris was observed the reservoir for the hydraulic system was drained and visually inspected for debris a small metallic object which appeared to be a curved portion of a wiretype spring approximately  of an inch long was visibly observed to be in the bottom of the hydraulic reservoir no other debris was observed in the hydraulic reservoir parkingemergency brake system the parkingemergency brake system was a springapplied hydraulic release internal wet disctype brake acting on the transmission the system had two modes of application manual or automatic this system was designed so it could be manually applied using a pushpull control mounted in the dash panel pull to apply push to release automatic application would occur if the steering circuit pressure dropped below approximately  psig although tests conducted indicated that both modes of application functioned the parkingemergency brake system was not designed to automatically apply in the event of a loss of pressure in the service brake systems front andor rear a pullthrough type test was conducted on the parkingemergency brake system as per the manufacturers recommendation the parking brake was applied the transmission was placed in nd gear forward direction and the engine speed increased from idle to wideopenthrottle the parking brake held the machine environment the temperature was  degrees and the working area was dry lighting from the shop lights and the miners lights provided adequate lighting the environment was not considered a factor in the accident training and experience bigler had received training in accordance with  cfr part  bigler had  years and  weeks mining experience all as a mechanic root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following causal factor was identified causal factor management standards polices and controls were inadequate because preoperation inspections to identify safety defects failed to identify that the forklifts service brake did not hold the machine with the engine turned off corrective action procedures should be established to ensure that all mobile equipment is inspected for defects prior to being placed into operation defects that affect safety should be corrected prior to persons using the equipment equipment operators should be trained and knowledgeable in identifying safety defects conclusion the accident occurred because the forklifts service brake system was not maintained in a functional condition policies standards and controls were inadequate because the examinations of the forklift failed to identify all safety defects the service brakes would not hold the forklift when

on march   when he was struck by a cable or jacking cylinders while aligning a cable for an aerial tramway he was in a man basket aligning the load cable with a monocular scope while coworkers monitored two jacking cylinders that pulled the cable toward him steel anchor arms securing the cable and jacking cylinders to a ground anchor failed and the cable or jacking cylinders struck him the accident occurred because management had not established procedures and policies to ensure that persons could safely tension tram cables during the tensioning process excess stress was placed on the anchor arms causing them to fail the capacity of the anchor arms was compromised when the end of the arms were cut to provide clearance for the cable grip attached to the arms the anchor arms were overstretched when a hydraulic power supply used to operate the jacking cylinders exerted a force greater than the strength of the anchor arms the pressure gauge on the hydraulic power supply was inoperable and the relief valve was not set to properly restrict pressure applied to the jacking cylinders general information the glass rock plant a surface industrial sand operation owned and operated by oglebay norton industrial sands inc was located near glenford perry county ohio the principal operating official was steven a bell general manager the mine normally operated three hour shifts per day and five days per week total employment was  persons sandstone was blasted from multiple benches and transported to the primary crusher by haul trucks the crushed material was conveyed to a loading terminal where buckets were filled and then hauled by the aerial tramway to a mill the material was pulverized dried screened and stored the finished product was sold for a variety of manufacturing applications the last regular inspection at this operation was completed on may   description of the accident on march   the day before the accident david l flowers victim eric watkins haul truck driver william e tullius tramway operator and byron mitchell welder added approximately  inches of slack to the cable of the aerial tram at a fixed anchor to prepare the load cable for pulling on march   the day of the accident flowers reported to work at  am his normal starting time flowers tullius mitchell watkins and steven t dittoe haul truck operator worked in the maintenance shop until it was light enough to work outdoors about  am flowers and mitchell attached a repair clamp to a section of excessively worn cable while tullius prepared the jacking cylinders and hydraulic power supply to pull the cable flowers used a comealong to hoist the jacking cylinders into position tullius and mitchell monitored the cylinders as the cable was pulled flowers observed the cable from the manlift basket tullius flowers and mitchell tightened the pulling grip on the upper end of the jacking cylinders to the cable for each pull they loosened the holding grip on the lower end of the jacking cylinder and applied hydraulic pressure to retract the cylinders after each pull the holding grip on the lower end was tightened the pulling grip on the upper end was loosened and the cylinders were retracted the cable was pulled twice to take up the cable slack no buckets were resting on the load cable at this time at  am dittoe came to the work site and the third pull was attempted two loaded buckets were added and the cable was pulled to recheck the sag flowers was standing in the manlift basket checking for proper cable sag with a monocular scope after the jacking cylinders pulled approximately  foot of cable flowers told tullius the cable wasnt moving tullius placed the toggle control valve on the hydraulic power supply in the neutral position tightened a leaking hose fitting and reengaged the lever dittoe saw the cable moving took a few steps back turned toward mitchell and heard a loud crash the anchor arms failed and the cylinders grips and cable suddenly released towards flowers and struck him dittoe was struck by the tail of the cable tullius checked on flowers and dittoe and ran to the shop to call for emergency medical assistance dittoe was transported to a local hospital where he was treated for a broken leg flowers was pronounced dead at the scene by the perry county coroner the cause of death was attributed to head trauma investigation of the accident the mine safety and health administration msha was notified of the accident at  pm edt on march   by a telephone call from raymond e garey mechanic crew leader to mshas emergency hotline gerald d holeman assistant district manager was called and an investigation was started that day an order was issued pursuant to section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners mshas accident investigation team traveled to the mine conducted a physical inspection of the accident site interviewed employees and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management employees and representatives of the state of ohio division of mineral resources management discussion location of the accident the accident occurred at the aerial tramway loading terminal appendix c figure  the victim was positioned in a manlift approximately  feet above the ground under the cable saddle where the loaded buckets left the loading terminal rail and transitioned onto the load cable weather rain fell throughout the day of the accident and the temperature was approximately  degrees fahrenheit weather was not considered a factor in the accident equipment aerial tramway the tramway was built circa  and was relocated in  in  the loading terminal was relocated and the connecting section of the tramway was shortened and the towers were lowered the aerial tramway system was divided into three sections a loading terminal section  feet a center section  feet and a discharge terminal section  feet the system was comprised of a load return and tow cable the load and return cables were static cables with anchors at the ends of each tramway section the loaded aerial buckets were conveyed on the static cables by the active tow cable from the loading terminal to the processing mill at the discharge terminal the buckets had a volume capacity of  cubic feet and weighed approximately  tons when loaded the cable involved in the accident was the foot section load cable that began at the loading terminal this cable was a ï¿½inch diameter steel double full lock coil track rope manufactured by fatzer ag it weighed  pounds per foot and had a minimum breaking strength of  pounds cable anchors the static cable anchors consisted of a doublechannel beam set in a concrete anchor block buried in the ground a pinned divider bar served as the connection between the ground anchor beam and the four anchor arms the other end of the anchor arms were pinned to a cable holding grip that secured the tramway cable to the anchor arm assembly appendix c figure  the four anchor arms were configured as two pairs the arms were designed using  inch steel plate ï¿½ inches long and  inches wide with two  inch diameter pinholes centered ï¿½ inches from the ends of the plate one pair was positioned above the cable and the other pair was positioned below the cable for clarification and orientation the two pairs were described as top and bottom the arms were noted as left and right oriented with respect to the cable running from the loading terminal to tower  the anchor arms were referenced as topleft topright bottomleft and bottomright three of the anchor arms failed due to block shear rupture which allowed the steel to tear between the end of the arm and the pinhole appendix b photos  and  the exception was the bottomleft arm where the pin slid out instead of tearing through the pinhole appendix b photo  based on the physical evidence the anchor arms released in the sequence of bottomright topright topleft then bottomleft when the first three arms failed the pin holding the bottomleft arm was able to pivot and slide free the end of the anchor arms had been thermally cut to address clearance problems between the anchor arms and the holding grip this reduced the amount of steel available to resist the pin load and increased the shear stresses in the anchor arm investigators determined that three of the arms had been cut twice the rough surfaces left by the cuts created stress concentrations at notches in the material further reducing the capacity of the arms the connection of the anchor arms to the holding grip were continuous with little space between the connecting plates the connection of the anchor arms to the divider plate had gaps between the plates causing play and uneven loading in these connections additional play was caused by wear and corrosion of the pinholes which allowed  inch to  inch clearance between the pin and the pinhole the anchor arms were coated with silver paint over red paint or primer the coating was worn and corrosion was observed across the anchor arms deformation of the anchor arms formed a crack pattern in the paint around the pinholes a similar pattern was engrained in the corrosion indicating that the arms had been previously overloaded a section was removed from the bottomleft anchor arm and tested to determine the material properties the bottomleft anchor arm was selected to preserve the condition of the three anchor arms that sheared since there were no discernible differences between the four anchor arms testing showed that the metallurgical composition of the steel met the specifications for aisisae  steel the yield strength of the steel was  psi and the ultimate tensile strength was  psi hydraulic power supply and jacking cylinders a hydraulic power supply was used to operate the jacking cylinders for the cable tensioning operation the power supply consisted of a gasoline motordriven pump a control valve a relief valve and a pressure gauge the pump control valve and cylinders were rated for a maximum working pressure of  psi the hoses connecting the components were rated for  psi and the pressure gauge was rated for  psi the pressure gauge was not functional the gauge was positioned facing away from the controls such that persons operating the equipment could not read the pressure the relief valve was adjustable between  psi and  psi and operated to restrict the maximum operating pressure produced by the hydraulic power supply the relief valve knob used for adjusting the pressure was missing when tested the pressure setting was approximately  psi the test indicated that the hydraulic power supply was capable of applying up to  psi on the cylinders at the time of the accident the cylinders and relief valve were disassembled and inspected and were found to be in good condition with no indication of any malfunctions the two jacking cylinders were manufactured by hanna cylinders circa  and were rebuilt by rm fluid power inc in  the cylinders had a inch diameter bore a inch stroke and a ï¿½ inch diameter rod the cylinders were yoked together in a parallel arrangement so each cylinder attached to an anchor arm pair and acted together to produce the pulling force on a cable being tensioned appendix c figure  based on the relief valve setting of  psi the maximum retraction force created by the two cylinders was approximately  pounds or  pounds per anchor arm estimate failure loadpressure the load required to cause the anchor arms to fail was estimated using empirical equations for block shear rupture tear and the material properties acquired from testing using these calculations investigators determined that the first anchor arm failed at an estimated load of  pounds equating to a hydraulic pressure on the jacking cylinders of  psi if the end of the anchor arm had not been cut calculations showed that it would fail at approximately  pounds equating to a hydraulic pressure on the jacking cylinders of  psi an engineering drawing at the mine showed that the maximum pressure on the cylinders was intended to be  psi for a cylinder load of  pounds and a load per anchor arm of  pounds calculations revealed that the placement of full buckets on the cable during the third pull significantly increased the required tension in the cable and placed a significantly higher load on the anchor arms considering the weight of the cable and the catenary geometry including the cable sag the cable tension was approximately  pounds without buckets and about  pounds with buckets another calculation was made to determine the cable elastic elongation stretch these calculations indicated that the  inches of slack pulled from the cable during the three pulls would create a load approximately equivalent to the intended design capacity of the anchor arms finally a review of the anchor arm behavior using finite element analyses indicated that regions of high stress were consistent with block shear failure the analysis showed that the stress concentration on the outside edge of the arm initiated tearing from the end of the anchor arm and progressed towards the pinhole training and experience flowers had  years mining experience and had received training in accordance with  cfr part  he had provided onthejob training to coworkers assisting him in the cable tensioning procedure he had approximately  years experience in cable tensioning work stephen t dittoe had  years mining experience and had received training in accordance with  cfr part  he had assisted in the load cable tensioning procedure approximately  times and in adjusting the tow cable one to two times per year during the last six years dittoes training on cables was by onthejob instruction william e tullius had  years mining experience and had received training in accordance with  cfr part  tullius had been tramway operator since april   he had helped flowers tension cables three times and had received onthejob instruction byron mitchell had  years mining experience and had received training in accordance with  cfr part  mitchell had helped tension cables  to  times mitchells training on cables was by onthe job instruction root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following root causes were identified root cause management did not have policies procedures and controls in place so persons could safely tension cables on the aerial tram no assessment of the risk involved in this work assignment was completed the pressure gauge and relief valve were nonfunctional on the hydraulic power supply used to complete the task corrective action management should establish policies procedures and controls so persons can safely tension cables on the aerial tram all equipment and tools should be inspected and operating properly a secondary restraint should be provided to ensure that the cable can not accidentally be released during tensioning persons performing the task should be trained regarding safe work procedures before any cables are tensioned root cause management did not ensure that the tramway was adapted to support all loads imposed on the tramway components the anchor arms used to secure the cable were stressed beyond their yield point the ends of the anchor arms had been cut to clear the cable grips corrective action management should ensure that component stresses and anchorage loads are analyzed so the tramway can support all loads imposed on its components conclusion the accident occurred because management had not established procedures and policies to ensure that persons could safely tension tram cables during the tensioning process excess stress was placed on the anchor arms causing them to fail the capacity of the anchor arms was compromised when the end of the arms were cut to provide clearance for the cable grip attached to the arms the material at the pin connections was reduced allowing the arms to fail at a lower load than required originally the anchor arms were overstretched and fractured when the hydraulic power supply used to operate the jacking cylinders exerted a force greater than the strength of the anchor arms the pressure gauge on the hydraulic power supply was not functioning and the relief valve was not set to properly restrict

age  was fatally injured on november   when an electric motor suddenly moved as it was being lifted with a truck mounted mobile crane the victim was standing between the motor and the crusher while a coworker attempted to pry the motor off its mounting bolts the accident occurred because the procedures used to lift the motor were inadequate the weight of the load exceeded the rated lift capacity of the crane for the angle and boom configuration used at the time of the accident the victim was not clear of the suspended load when the lift was made general information the celina quarry a crushed limestone operation operated by rogers group inc was located at celina clay county tennessee the principal operating official was jesse gilliam area superintendent the mine had ceased production and sales on november   the plant was being dismantled and the crusher was to be moved to another mine location total employment when the mine was operating was seven persons limestone had been mined from benches in the quarry limestone was drilled blasted and hauled to the primary crusher by truck it was then screened to various sizes and crushed again to a desired grade the finished rock was loaded from bins transported to stock piles and sold as construction aggregate the last regular inspection at this operation was completed on november   description of accident on the day of the accident bennett reported to work at  am at the algood quarry where he was employed as a plant operatorrepairman he conducted the daily safety meeting for the other employees bennett drove to the celina quarry where he was to help cameron howard maintenance foreman dismantle an impact crusher the dismantling of the crusher required removing some sections of conveyor belt framing an overhead trolley frame at the crusher and the feed hopper to the crusher a truck mounted mobile crane was used to lift the components as they were dismantled the crane boom had to be extended over and beyond the impact crusher in order to reach the crushers drive motor the position of other conveyor belts and structures as well as overhead power lines prevented parking the mobile crane so the operator could see the motor while it was being lifted about  am a torch was used to cut off the mounting bolt heads for the crusher drive motor the vbelts connecting the two drive pulleys were still connected and tight the motor base adjusting screws were corroded and caked with limestone howard stated that they wanted to reuse the vbelts so they did not cut them free of the pulleys the decision was made to utilize the mobile crane to lift the motor off the base howard operated the crane and was attempting to lift the motor from its base but the motor would not come loose howard could feel the front outriggers on the boom truck moving off the ground when he applied lifting pressure about  pm he set the boom controls to maintain tension on the cables howard left the crane controls and found a short piece of triangular shaped metal that he placed over a  inch x  inch block of wood using this as a lever he tried to pry the motor loose bennett was leaning over the vbelts to determine the reason the motor would not move when it suddenly came loose the motor swung toward the metal crusher housing and struck him howard placed bennett on the side of the walkway next to the crusher before he ran to the crane and

the attending emergency room physician death was attributed to blunt force trauma investigation of the accident msha was notified of the accident at  pm by a telephone call from ed elliott corporate safety director to wyatt s andrews acting assistant district manager an order was issued under the provisions of section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners mshas investigators made a physical inspection of the accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and employees discussion location the accident occurred at the impact crusher located at the secondary plant crusher tower crusher the impact crusher was a model  pettibone universal eight large vbelts connected the crusher drive to the motor the motor mounting mechanism had a feature that would allow the motor to be adjusted to tighten the belts for operation and loosen the belts for removal there was no evidence showing that these adjustment bolts had been moved prior to the accident at the time the motor was being removed the belts remained in place and were tensioned motor the  horsepower electric motor weighed  pounds no other information including the manufacturer was legible horizontal loading the belts were in tension at the time of the accident adding to the force being directed to the side of the motor where the victim was located the pressure applied to the motor by the crane also caused the boom to flex toward the load and caused the outriggers to rise while upward pressure was applied to the motor this configuration placed potential energy on the motor causing it to rise once the obstruction that prevented free movement was removed one of the generic warnings posted on each side of the crane warned crane load ratings on outriggers are based on freely suspended loads with the machine leveled and standing on a firm uniform supporting surface no attempt shall be made to move a load horizontally on the ground in any direction riggingtaglineschains the chain used to secure the motor to the lifting hook of the crane was a  inch grade  chain that was  feet  inches long it was rated at  pounds on straight pull no physical damage or stretching of the chain was observed the angle to which the chain would have been rigged at the time of the accident was not a pure straight pull however this angle still provided load capacity of the chain for the weight of the motor the victim was positioned between the motor and the crusher immediately prior to the movement of the motor no blocking material or taglines were available or in use to secure the motor or prevent it from swinging mobile crane the crane involved in the accident was a manitex model a mobile crane mounted on a  ford f truck chassis the truck was placed in position on the morning of the accident to assist in the dismantling of the crusher installation the boom truck had not been repositioned after the accident the outriggers were in good physical condition and located on a compacted gravel base there were no leaks observed in the cranes hydraulic system supporting the outriggers or the cable winch evaluation of the crane loading although the truck had not been moved since the accident the position of the crane had been changed from the time of the accident and the time of the accident investigation to lower the victim to the ground to assist emergency responders during the accident investigation the crane boom was repositioned to reconstruct its approximate location at the time of the accident this enabled investigators to read boom angle and boom extension length both critical to proper load capacity calculations at the time of the accident the boom was extended out at least  feet but investigators could not determine the exact length a load ratings chart was mounted on each side of the operators compartment on the mobile crane operating radius  feet measured boom length  feet the chart was specific to this crane and was accompanied with other instructions that are generic to all cranes the position of the crane at the time of the accident resulted in an operating radius of  feet for lifting the subject motor as measured during the accident investigation this was the horizontal distance from the crane center to the center of the load to be lifted as measured during the accident investigation using the chart provided on the crane the  feet operating radius was between the numbers  and  the boom length was then charted for an extended length of  feet approximate the crane was observed to be at a  degree boom angle using these numbers the load rating resulted in a safe lifting capacity of  pounds the motor weighed  pounds therefore the safe lifting range of the crane was exceeded training and experience woncie lee bennett had  years and  weeks total mining experience he had worked for this company for  years and had received annual refresher training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following causal factors were identified causal factor a risk assessment to determine all possible hazards and to establish safe work procedures was not conducted prior to attempting to lift the motor no procedures were in place to ensure persons were clear of suspended loads the motor was not being lifted in a manner that protected persons from the hazard of the suspended load corrective action procedures should be established that require a risk assessment be conducted to identify and correct potential hazards associated with the task to be performed develop and implement safe crane operating procedures that ensure persons are protected from the hazards of working around suspended loads causal factor standards and controls were inadequate and failed to ensure the crane was utilized properly instructions in the operators manual were not followed prior to making the lift with the crane the weight of the load being lifted was not within the manufacturers specified lift capacity based on the angle and position of the boom corrective action procedures should be established that require personnel to be familiar with and use the manufacturers load charts when loads are being lifted and moved conclusion the accident occurred because the procedures used to lift the motor were inadequate the weight of the load exceeded the rated lift capacity of the crane for the angle and boom configuration used at the time of the accident the victim was not clear of the suspended load when the lift was made violations order no  was issued on november   under the provisions of section k of the mine act a fatal accident occurred at this mine on november   when the maintenance crew was attempting to remove an electric motor at the secondary plants impact crusher this order is issued to assure the safety of all persons at this operation it prohibits activity at the area where the motor was being removed until msha has determined that it is safe to resume normal mining operations in the area the mine operator shall obtain prior approval

for violation of  cfr  a fatal accident occurred at this mine on november   when a motor suspended from the load line of a crane swung free from its mounting location and struck a maintenance worker the task proceeded although the victim was not clear of the suspended load this citation was terminated on january   all employees were instructed in the proper procedures to be practiced while working around suspended loads additional training was conducted with persons who operate cranes on mine property order no  was issued on december   under the provisions of section d of the mine act for violation of  cfr  a fatal accident occurred at this mine on november   when a motor suspended from the load line of a crane swung free from its mounting location and struck a maintenance worker the crane was used beyond the design capacity intended by the manufacturer in that the weight of the load exceeded the rated lift capacity for the angle of the boom at the length it had been extended due to the cranes lifting capacity being exceeded it was unable to freely lift the motor the victim was attempting to assist in freeing the motor from its location failure to utilize the load limits on the load chart which sets forth the safe lifting capacity of the motor constituted more than ordinary negligence and is an unwarrantable failure to comply with a mandatory safety standard this

the area for drilling boris drove his pickup truck to the staging area at the top of the highwall where both dozers were parked boris did a walk around inspection of the d dozer after starting the dozer boris and endicott discussed the job and the procedures they were going to use to push the remaining overburden over the edge of the highwall they decided that endicott would push material over the edge and boris would push in the trench that had been established previously endicott said he was going to wait until daylight to push material over the edge of the highwall boris stated he was going to make a couple of passes in the trench he made the first pass while endicott watched from the d dozer parked on the side of the trench opposite the edge of the highwall when boris made the second pass endicott moved the d dozer down into the trench and traveled a short distance endicott then backed the dozer out of the trench and parked on a slight hill on the opposite side of the

management employees and the local sheriffs office discussion location of the accident the accident occurred at the edge of the highwall on the east side of the quarry the highwall where the dozer overtraveled the edge was approximately  feet high the main trench where the dozer had been working was approximately  feet long running at an angle toward the edge of the highwall the dump point was located at the end of the trench about  feet from the highwalls edge this was the first time that two dozers had worked together in this area the weather was cloudy with intermittent rain and a temperature of approximately  degrees fahrenheit the accident occurred at approximately  am the sun rose at  am there was no natural illumination present at the time of the accident the only illumination available was provided by the lights on the two dozers which illuminated directly in front and to the rear of the equipment there was no illumination on the sides of the dozers equipment the machine involved in the accident was a  caterpillar model dm track dozer equipped with a vpat variable pitch power angle tilt blade it was powered by an inline cylinder caterpillar model  turbocharged diesel engine rated at  horsepower the gross weight of the dozer was  pounds the dozer had a caterpillar model cyl  transmission with three forward speeds and three reverse speeds it had extra wide tracks that provided low ground pressure for working in soft material the machine cab was an open design with a roll over protective structure rops canopy although the canopy was damaged during the accident the operators working area under the canopy was not compromised the rops certification tag was located on the outside of the canopys right support post the investigation of the machine did not reveal any defects except for damage caused by the accident seat belt the dozer was equipped with a seat belt which was found unbuckled after the accident the seat belt had a tag with punchout numbers that indicated the date it was installed but the numbers on this tag were not punched out the seat belt was not damaged and the buckle latched and unlatched properly lights the bulldozer had two running lights in the front and two running lights in the rear the light on the left front was damaged and the two rear lights were torn off the machine during the accident all four lights were illuminated at the time of the accident training and experience dwight j boris had ten years mining experience as a heavy equipment operator and had operated the dozer that was involved in the accident for approximately two years he had received training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was performed and the following factors were identified root cause standards and controls were inadequate and failed to require auxiliary lighting to be installed when work was performed near elevated areas during darkness corrective action management should establish policies that require auxiliary lighting during non daylight hours when selfpropelled mobile equipment is operated near drop offs or at elevated areas root cause controls were inadequate and did not ensure the operator of the dozer wore his seat belt when operating the equipment corrective action management should strengthen and monitor their mandatory seat belt requirement by doing spot checks of the equipment operators to increase employee awareness of the necessity of wearing seat belts conclusion the accident occurred because illumination to provide safe working conditions was not provided in the work area where the dozer was operated it was determined that the victim may have become disorientated due to darkness and the position of the other dozer the victims failure to wear the provided seat belt may have contributed to his inability to regain control before the dozer overtraveled the edge of the highwall enforcment actions order no  was issued on january   under the

safety training discussion location of the accident the accident occurred along the haul road leading from the  level to the waste dump on the  level along this section the road was  feet to  feet wide and in good condition weather on the day of the accident the weather was cloudy with a temperature of  degrees fahrenheit weather was not considered to be a factor in the accident haul truck the truck involved in the accident was an ton caterpillar c offroad haul truck manufactured in  it was powered by a caterpillar model   hp cylinder diesel engine the transmission was a caterpillar electronicallycontrolled automatic power shift transmission with seven speeds forward and one speed in reverse the truck weighed approximately  pounds empty and had a manufacturers rated gross vehicle weight of  pounds brake system the truck was equipped with an air over hydraulic service brake system and a springapplied hydraulic park brake system the brake system used enclosed wet disc brake units at each of its four wheels the brake units on the rear wheels were a combination of a hydraulicallyapplied service brake and a hydraulicallyreleased springapplied park brake both the park brake and service brake in the rear brake unit used the same wet disc pack the front brake units were hydraulicallyapplied enclosed wet disc brakes when the service brake pedal was applied the brake control system caused hydraulic pressure to apply both the front and rear brake units the park brake toggle control was mounted in front of the gear shift lever when the park brake toggle control was pushed forward the brake control system caused hydraulic pressure to release it a toggle control had to be pulled back to apply the park brake the secondary brake which acted as an emergency brake was activated by a handle mounted to the left side of the steering column when activated the secondary brake was designed to apply both the front service brake and the rear park brake the brake system had a retarder circuit controlled by a handle mounted to the right of the steering column this control applied both the front and rear service brakes the retarder controlled the speed of the haul truck while descending grades the truck had an enginedriven air compressor that supplied air pressure for the brake system controls and the airapplied hydraulic master cylinder for the service brake system it supplied air pressure for two air tanks for the service brake system a third air tank received air pressure from the service brake supply tanks and supplied the secondary brake system the air compressor was controlled by a governor that maintained the air system pressure between  psi and psi steering the truck had a hydraulic steering system with a separate reservoir it had two steering cylinders and two steering pumps that provided hydraulic pressure to a steering control valve the main steering pump was driven by the trucks engine an electrical driven pump provided emergency steering in case the engine shut down or the main steering pump failed investigators gathered information to determine why the wheels did not turn back toward the center of the road after the truck contacted the berm the manufacturer stated that the truck would continue to travel in the direction set by the steering wheel except in situations where the front wheels made an extreme impact with an object during this accident the truck did not have an extreme impact with the berm therefore there would not be a change in the steering direction information obtained from the manufacturer revealed that the steering on the truck was not selfcentering like an automobiles steering when the steering wheel was turned the truck would continue to turn even if the driver released the steering wheel a test conducted on a truck that was identical to the truck involved in the accident confirmed the trucks steering actions seat belt the seat belt was not damaged in the accident the seat belt buckle latched unlatched and retracted properly when tested summary  the evaluation of the truck involved in the accident did not reveal any defects  the steering on the truck involved in the accident was not selfcentering the truck would continue to travel in the direction set by the steering wheel except in situations where the front wheels made an extreme impact with an object the truck did not make an extreme impact with the berm during this accident  the haul road was in good condition  tests were conducted on the haul road where the accident occurred using a loaded truck that was the same model as the truck involved in the accident these tests showed that at a speed of  mph the truck traveled approximately  feet in less than  seconds training charles a wroe had  years  weeks and  days mining experience he had received training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was performed and the following causal factors were identified causal factor the truck driver did not maintain control of the truck he was operating corrective action procedures should be established to ensure that truck drivers operate mobile equipment safely causal factor management policies and procedures did not ensure that the truck driver wore his seat belt when operating the truck corrective action management should regularly check truck drivers to ensure seat belts are being worn conclusion the accident occurred because the victim did not maintain control of the truck however the investigators were unable to determine why he did not the examination of the truck did not identify any defects the victim was not wearing a seat belt which contributed to the severity of his injuries enforcement actions order no  was issued on april   under the provisions of

r petrie district manager overview charles r davis iii supervisor age  was fatally injured on february   when he was struck by a pitman assembly that was being removed from the crusher at the secondary plant a crane operated by a contractor employee was being used to remove the pitman assembly davis was standing on the work platform with two other employees the accident occurred because safe work procedures were not utilized to protect persons working at the location the signal to raise boom was given before the work area was cleared of personnel no training had been provided for the miners prior to performing the task regarding hand signals that were to be used between the miners and the crane operator general information pyramid materials a surface crushed stone operation owned and operated by pyramid materials div  haines kibblehouse inc was located in media delaware county pennsylvania the principal operating official was john b haines iv president and john r kibblehouse secretarytreasurer the mine operated one hour shift six days per week total employment was seven persons amquip msha contractor id no et was an independent contracting crane service located in bensalem bucks county pennsylvania the principal operating official was frank bardonaro jr general manager amquip was contracted by the mine operator to provide a crane to pick the crusher component stone was blasted from multiple benches and transported by frontend loader to the crushing plant where it was broken and separated into various size materials finish products were sold as construction aggregate the last regular inspection at this operation was completed on october   description of the accident on the day of the accident charles r davis iii victim reported for work at  am his normal starting time the planned work for the day was to dismantle the b jaw crusher for repairs davis discussed the task with michael syorden loader operator and david a velas mechanic they removed snow and ice from the work area and removed guards from the crusher in preparation for the work thomas heenan contract crane operator arrived with the crane at approximately  am heenan moved the crane into position and set it up to perform the work five crane picks were made the first pick was to remove a ladder that provided access to the screen deck above the crusher the second pick was to remove a steel plate at the crusher and the third and forth were to remove the bearing caps on the pitman assembly the fifth and final pick was the pitman assembly the removal of the pitman assembly was difficult because the surrounding structures restricted the crane placement as a result the cranes hoist line could not be positioned directly above the pitman the miners used metal pry bars as they attempted to maneuver the pitman assembly to enable the crane to lift it about  pm when the crew thought that the assembly was free a hand signal was given to the crane operator to raise boom and the miners started to exit the walkway at the crusher as the pitman assembly cleared the crusher the miners saw it swing toward them yorden fell to the work platform turned and saw the assembly traveling over him velas turned to travel down the stairs and felt something hit him in the back velas turned and caught davis as he was falling down the stairs behind him davis appeared to be unconscious and was carried to the ground by velas and yorden velas used his cell phone and heenan ran to the scale house to call for emergency medical assistance davis was transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead death was attributed to crushing blunt force trauma investigation of the accident msha was notified of the accident at  pm on february   by a telephone call from ronald landis safety director to robert l carter supervisory mine safety and health inspector an investigation was started that day an order was issued under the provisions of section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of miners mshas accident investigation team traveled to the mine made a physical inspection of the accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management employees pennsylvania department of environmental protection inspectors and the contractors management and employees discussion location of the accident the accident occurred on the platform of the a and b jaw crushers located at the secondary plant the work was being conducted on the b jaw crusher the weather was clear and cool however there had been a significant snow fall over the weekend crusher the crusher involved in the accident was a gator pex  jaw crusher the crusher section had two units designated as a and b the employees were removing the b crusher unit pitman assembly at the time of the accident this crusher was being dismantled for scheduled repairs the crusher tower unit was configured as a tall rectangular metallic structure with two sections an upper screening section and a lower crushing section the screening section had a catwalkhandrail installed around the perimeter of the section for access during screen maintenance the crusher section had a catwalkhandrail installed around the perimeter of the section for access during crusher maintenance the pitman assembly or jaw was the component being picked during the accident the jaw was driven through a multi grooved vbelt pulley attached to one end of a large eccentric shaft with a flywheel attached to the other end of the shaft the jaw was supported by bearings located on this eccentric shaft the pitman assembly body was constructed of heavy cast metal with an assembly weight of  pounds a single cast lifting lug was positioned on top of the pitman assembly the placement of this lifting lug permitted a single point balanced load during lifting of the pitman assembly appendix b describes the pitman assembly crane the crane used to lift the pitman assembly was a koehring model t ton capacity truck mounted crane it was suitable for use on improved terrain and was equipped with five outrigger jacks the crane had four extendable box beam outriggers with vertical stabilizer jacks that were located on the main portion of the lifting platform and used for over the rear and side stationary picks the fifth vertical outrigger jack located on the front of the crane carrier was used when picking loads over the front of the machine the crane had dual drive axles in the rear a single nondriven steering axle in the front and was equipped with overtheroad tires on all axles it had two control cabs one lower cab mounted on a truck carrier for driving the crane onroad and a separate upper cab mounted on a turntable superstructure used when picking and moving loads the lifting boom of the crane was a hydraulically driven foursection fully synchronized full power boom with a removable telescoping boom extension the hoist was fitted with a  inch diameter wire rope with a pound hoist ball and hook attached to the end of the rope the load line was rigged as a single part line with a rating of  pounds the crane was equipped with a safety cut out system that would only allow a load to be lowered in an overload situation the crane operator simulated the pick without a load the outriggers boom functions and hoist operations appeared smooth and continuous without any unwanted motions there were no visible signs of any substantial fluid leakage from under or around the crane and related components no operational defects were found crane positioning the crane placement was limited due to the configuration of the surrounding structures the crane carrier was backed into the location the crane placement dictated that the lift would have to be done by picking the pitman assembly from a lower level catwalk of the crusher unit over the left rear corner of the crane and swinging the boom to the right over the rear of the crane to lower the pitman assembly to the ground the configuration of an upper catwalk located on a screen section of the crusher unit prevented a straight and unrestricted vertical pick and caused the lifting line to scrape against the upper catwalk this lifting configuration was not an acceptable practice according to the crane manufacturer the cranes operating manual clearly stated the following no attempt shall be made to drag a load horizontally on the ground in any direction when the crane picked the pitman assembly from the mounting location an external force was exerted onto the pitman when it slid up and out of the mount this type of external force is similar to using the hoist rope to drag an object on the ground at the time of the accident the crane was configured as follows four extendable box beam outriggers fully extended vertical stabilizer jacks extended downward lifting platform level and tires suspended above the ground boom extension stowed on side of main boom a pound hoist ball and a single part lifting line the crane was found in a collapsed and stowed condition reportedly the crane was not moved from the original location only stowed this stowed configuration was typically the way a crane would be stored after a job is completed or for transporting the boom extension was stowed on the side of the main boom appendix c indicates the relative position of the crane to the pitman assembly picking position training and experience charles r davis iii had  ï¿½ years mining experience all at this mine he had received training in accordance with  cfr part  the crew had not received training on hand signals prior to starting the repair task the crane operator was given the signal to raise boom rather than hoist this action may have resulted in the pitman assembly swinging as it was moved by the crane root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following factors were identified root cause a risk assessment to determine all possible hazards and to establish safe work procedures was not conducted prior to performing the task no procedures were in place to ensure that persons were clear of suspended loads the location of the pitman assembly in relation to the upper level screening section catwalk on the crusher prevented a straight perpendicular and unrestricted crane pick causing the lifting line to scrape against the upper catwalk corrective action procedures should be established that require a risk assessment be conducted to identify and correct potential hazards associated with the task to be performed develop and implement safe crane operating procedures that ensure all lifting is completed according to manufacturers operators manual establish policies that require persons to stay clear of suspended loads root cause standards and controls were inadequate and failed to ensure that training regarding hand signals was provided to the miners by the contractors crane operator before performing the task corrective action procedures should be established to require that all mine and contract employees receive training regarding the proper use of hand signals when cranes are utilized to lift loads conclusion the accident occurred because safe work procedures were not utilized to protect persons working at the location the work area was not cleared of personnel prior to hoisting the pitman assembly to ensure they were clear of the suspended load training regarding hand signals was not provided to the miners prior to performing the task enforcement actions pyramid materials div  haines kibblehouse inc order no  was issued on february   under the provisions of section k of the mine act a fatal accident occurred at this operation on

notified of the accident at  am cst on august   by a telephone call from the tarmac safety manager to wyatt s andrews supervisory mine safety and health inspector an investigation was started the same day an order was issued under the provisions of section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners mshas accident investigators traveled to the mine made a physical inspection of the accident scene conducted interviews and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management employees and contractor personnel discussion accident location the accident occurred near the bottom of an inclined road approximately  feet from the primary crusher from the primary crusher the roadway was level for  feet to the crest of the exit roadway the inclined section of this roadway was  feet long with an  to  percent grade the roadway was  feet wide with a foot high dirt bank on one side and a  feet high berm on the side adjacent to a water filled pit at the base of the inclined section approximately  feet from the primary crusher the haul road widened and could accommodate two way traffic to the pit a mile away the roadways entering and leaving the crusher area were used for one way travel the truck struck the side bank with the right front tire approximately  feet from the crest of the roadway the grade in this area was approximately  percent the roadway was dry and there were no skid marks from braking the trucks speed at the time the truck struck the bank and berm could not be determined weather at the time of accident the weather was clear with no wind and a temperature of  degrees fahrenheit haul truck the haul truck involved in the accident was a  caterpillar c equipped with a dump bed a caterpillar  eui diesel engine with a gross power rating of  horsepower and a  speed automatic transmission caterpillar lists the empty weight of the model c as approximately  pounds the truck was submerged in the water filled pit for  days before being recovered it had substantial water damage that prevented the engine from being operated all system tests were conducted using remote air and hydraulic pressure sources and secondary steering pressure as required no visual damage to the braking and steering systems was identified electrical repairs were made to test the braking and steering systems the haul truck was  feet  inch long and had a wheelbase of approximately  feet the trucks track width was  feet  inches with a rear midaxle height of approximately  feet  inches a blind area of approximately  feet existed around the right front corner of a similar model machine as observed from the operators seat when trying to view objects approximately five feet above the ground air system the air system did not sustain any visible damage during the accident tests indicated the truck had a leak rate of approximately  pounds per square inch psi per minute with the engine off the source of the leak was determined to be the drain valve for the parking and secondary brake release air tank the investigation determined that this defect did not contribute to the accident service brake system the truck had a dualcircuit air over hydraulic service brake system one hydraulic circuit for the steering axle service brakes and one hydraulic circuit for the drive axle service brakes it had air over hydraulicapplied service brakes at all four wheels with enclosed wet disc type brakes on the steering axle front brakes and on the drive axle rear brakes the service brakes were modulated by a foot pedal the air supply line for the air over hydraulic brake converter for the front brakes was found to be disconnected and plugged off at a fitting connection near the brake converter no supply air was getting to the brake converter when the service brake foot pedal was applied the investigators determined that this defect did not contribute to the accident and a noncontributory citation was issued the supply line was reconnected to the front brake converter and investigators determined that the air portion of the brake converter had an air leak tests indicated that the truck had a leak rate of approximately  psi per minute with a supply line to the front brake converter reconnected the service brakes fully applied and the engine off the air over hydraulic brake converter for the rear brakes functioned properly when tested the hydraulic pressure for the rear brakes was approximately equal to the  to  output ratio of the rear brake converter stated in the service manual testing indicated that the rear tires skidded on a hard packed rock surface when the truck was pushed and the service brakes fully applied using the foot pedal caterpillar form no senr october  page  retarder the retarder system on this truck used both the front and rear wet disc brakes air over hydraulic service brakes and was controlled by modulating a hand control lever on the right side of the steering column underneath the steering wheel the hand lever modulated the brake pressure to the rear service brakes when tested the retarder system used the same brake converters as the service brake system the plugged air line for the front brake converter made the front brakes inoperative during retarder operation secondary brakes the haul truck had a secondary brake system which was controlled by modulating a hand control lever on the left side of the steering column underneath the steering wheel this brake system actuated the air over hydraulic front service brakes and the spring applied parking brakes on the rear wheels the hand lever modulated the air pressure to the front brake converter and the parking brake hydraulic release pressure when tested however the secondary brake system used the same front brake converter as the service brake system the plugged air line for the front brake converter made the front brakes inoperative during secondary braking parking brake system the parking brake system was a springapplied hydraulic release system that used the same wet brake disc pack as the service brakes at each of the two rear wheels a flip switch mounted on the center console set and released the parking brake no defects were detected during testing of the parking brakes the switch operated the release pressure for the parking brakes when the system release pressure was supplied using a remote hydraulic pack the investigation determined that the braking systems provided on this caterpillar c truck would have provided the truck operator with the necessary braking ability to control the truck at the time of the accident steering systems the truck was equipped with a hydraulic steering system and a secondary steering system that provided electric over hydraulic pressure for the steering controls in the event of an engine shutdown the steering system was visually inspected and determined to be hydraulically and mechanically intact the electric driven hydraulic pump for the secondary steering system functioned when tested with the manual switch and was used to test the steering system no problems were identified with the steering system that would have affected the ability of the truck driver to control the truck at the time of the accident transmission the truck had a sevenspeed automatic transmission with electronic shift control the transmission selector lever was found in the seventh gear position in this position and with the maximum gear setting at seventh gear the transmission would automatically up shift and downshift throughout this speed range first through seventh depending on rear wheel speed and engine rpm without requiring the operator to manually shift the selector lever product literature indicated that the maximum machine speed in seventh gear was approximately  miles per hour engine throttle control the engine throttle was electronically controlled and could not be tested due to the electrical problems encountered during the field evaluation and the inability to run the engine the mechanical portion of the foot operated throttle pedal was tested and no binding or sticking was observed warning light indicators the dash board panel warning lights were tested before the electrical problems were encountered all of the warning lights lit when the panel test switch was placed in the on position seat belt a functional seat belt was provided for the operators seat tires and tire pressures the two tires on the front axle steering axle were r bridgestone r lug s tubeless radials with a two star rating the four tires on the rear axle drive axle were r goodyear rl tubeless radials with a two star rating a representative from gcr tire a contractor responsible for the mines tire maintenance measured the tire pressures table  for the truck the tire pressures were measured with an ambient temperature estimated at approximately ï¿½ f the representative stated that tires on this type of truck typically operate with approximately  psi in the front and the rear tires left side right side front axle  psi  psi outer dualinner dual inner dualouter dual rear axle  psi psi  psi psi training and experience jose r salgado had  days mining experience and  days experience driving haul trucks all at this operation he had received  hours of new miner training and  hours of task training root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following causal factors were identified causal factor management policies standards and controls were inadequate and failed to ensure that employees received task training in the health and safety aspects and safe work procedures related to operating haul trucks the drivers who trained the victim did not know the proper use of the retarder and brake systems to control the speed of the haul truck while traveling on down grades corrective action management should develop and establish procedures to ensure that equipment operators are task trained to safely operate mobile equipment equipment operators should consult the operators manual for proper procedures prior to performing tasks management should monitor employees to ensure that training is adequate instructors should be knowledgeable of the safe operating procedures of the mobile equipment they are training employees to operate causal factor management did not ensure that mobile equipment operators were wearing seat belts when operating mobile equipment corrective action procedures should be established which require management to regularly monitor equipment operators for seat belt usage conclusion the accident occurred because the task training procedures used were inadequate and did not ensure that the victim could safely operate the haul truck he had no previous experience operating mobile equipment competent trainers were not provided because the truck drivers who task trained the victim were unfamiliar with the safe operating procedures of the haul trucks they lacked knowledge of the retarder and braking systems provided on the haul trucks violations order no  was issued on august   under

 steven m richetta district manager overview donavon r dunblazier technicianutility heavy equipment operator age  was fatally injured on june   when the rubbertired crane he was operating overturned dunblazier either jumped or fell from the cab and was pinned under the crane at the time of the accident the victim was being trained to operate the crane the accident occurred because the procedures used to train a person to safely operate a crane were not effective the trainer did not remain in immediate contact at all times while task training the victim the outriggers and stabilizer jacks on the crane were not utilized the weight of the lift exceeded the crane manufacturers design lifting capacity on rubber and the cranes tires were underinflated for lifting on rubber general information minorca mine a surface iron ore taconite milling operation owned and operated by mittal steel usa minorca mine inc was located in virginia st louis county minnesota the principal operating official was jonathan h holmes operations manager the mine normally operated three hour shifts a day and seven days a week total employment was  persons iron ore was mined from a multiple bench open pit the material was then crushed and milled in a multiple step process iron was separated from the processed taconite ore and the iron rich concentrate added to a binder and rolled to form pellets the finished heathardened pellets were shipped and sold for steel manufacturing the last regular inspection of this mine was completed on march   description of accident on the day of the accident donavon r dunblazier victim reported for work at  am his normal starting time dunblazier who had been receiving task training to operate a crane was assigned to operate the crane and remove dewatering pumps and steel waterlines to prepare the pit for blasting henry w sande senior operator technician was to conduct the task training thomas r swanson richard c saari and michael d long millwrights were assigned to assist with these tasks dunblazier drove the crane to the work site arriving about  am he used the crane three times deploying the outriggers each time to lift water pumps and set them on a flatbed truck for removal from the area the crew then removed three foot sections of inch steel pipe from the pit sump waterlines each lift of pipe consisted of two foot sections joined with a coupler about  am the blast was made the all clear signal was given and the crew returned to the area and discovered that a foot section of pipe needed to be replaced because the flyrock damaged it sande observed dunblazier set up the crane and complete two lifts without deploying the cranes outriggers one lift was performed to remove the damaged section of pipe the replacement pipe was lowered into position in the second lift saari used a truck to pull two foot sections of pipe downhill dunblazier set the crane in position near the sections of pipe that saari moved but did not deploy the cranes outriggers as dunblazier was positioning the crane sande left the area walking up the hill to move his vehicle because it was blocking the road and a frontend loader needed to leave the area the cranes outriggers werent deployed as one of the foot sections of pipe was rigged and connected to the cranes boom hook the pipe was lifted and swanson connected it to the existing pipeline while long guided it from the opposite end at approximately  pm sande drove back down the hill exited his vehicle and quickly walked over to the open left side door of the crane he told dunblazier that the outriggers should be used for the lift dunblazier questioned the need for outriggers based on the weight of the pipe sande again told dunblazier to lower his outriggers and walked to the other side of the crane to see if the units nonweight wheels remained on the ground the cranes motor began to accelerate as sande turned to see the cranes boom begin to telescope out he then yelled boom down boom down as the crane began to slowly overturn he backed away from the machine as dunblazier either attempted to jump or fell from the cranes open door as the crane settled on its side the boom returned to the center position sande went back around the crane and found dunblazier pinned beneath the cranes cab saari witnessed the accident and used a cb radio to call for emergency medical assistance sande crawled into the crane cab and shut off the engine as other employees arrived cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr was administered until emergency medical personnel arrived dunblazier was transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead the cause of death was attributed to multiple blunt force trauma investigation of accident on the day of the accident the mine safety and health administration msha was notified at  pm by a telephone call from jaime l baggenstoss environmental and safety to mshas emergency hotline gerald d holeman assistant district manager was notified and an investigation was started the same day an order was issued pursuant to section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of miners mshas accident investigation team traveled to the mine conducted a physical inspection of the accident site interviewed employees and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management employees and miners representative discussion location of the accident the accident occurred on the dewatering pit road the road led from the upper benches to the pit floor where the sump and dewatering pumps were located the crane was positioned approximately midway down the road that had an approximate one percent grade and was composed of dry well packed ground material global positioning system gps elevations taken at the estimated location of the crane tires prior to the accident indicated that the crane may have been positioned in an area that was approximately five percent slope out of level this position would have the left front tire of the crane at the lowest elevation weather conditions the weather at the time of the accident was partly cloudy and  degrees fahrenheit with  to  mile per hour winds weather was not considered a factor in the accident mobile crane the crane involved in the accident was an omega model no  crane manufactured by ph harnischfeger in  it was a rough terrain selfpropelled mobile hydraulic unit rated at  tons capacity the crane super structure consisted of a rotating turntable a foot three section hydraulically powered boom a sheave hookblock a single lifting hoist and operators cab the crane carrier was equipped with deep lug tires fourwheel drive and fourwheel steering the crane was not provided with a loadmomentindicator shutdown device but was equipped with an antitwo block device an outrigger with a stabilizer jack was located on each corner of the carrier each outrigger consisted of a horizontal extendable outrigger box beam a vertical stabilizer jack attached to the end of the beam and an outrigger float attached to the bottom of the stabilizer jack these stabilizer jacksoutrigger beams were provided for leveling the crane and stabilizing the lifting platform manual control valves located in the operators cab were used for machine operation the controls for operating the outriggers were located on the right side console and consisted of four pairs eight total of electrical toggle switches each switch pair activated the extension or retraction of the individual horizontal outrigger beams and the extension or retraction of the individual vertical outrigger jacks crane postaccident condition after the accident the crane was on its left side with the partially extended and raised crane boom resting on top of the pipeline nylon web slings were attached to the pipeline and to the hookblock the outriggers were not extended and the stabilizer jacks were not lowered the superstructure cab and surrounding crane structures had minimal damage crane specifications the crane manufacturer provided specific stipulations regarding the load lifting capacity of the crane in part the manufacturers label in the cab specified the load rating capacities without using the stabilizer jacks depended on the capacity and condition of the tires information also provided in the cabs jib load chart indicated that the weight of hooks hook blocks slings and other load handling devices needed to be factored for the lift being made the hook block on the crane weighed  pounds the manufacturer specified the rated capacity of a crane is determined with the crane leveled within  of grade  foot drop or rise in  foot distance out of level more than  will drastically reduce the lifting capacity tire pressures the manufacturer specified a tire pressure of  pounds per square inch psi to obtain the maximum load capacity when lifting loads on the cranes tires the tire pressures were measured at approximately  psi on three tires and  psi on the left rear opposite the weighted lifting side lifted load at the time of the accident the victim was attempting to move two foot sections of inch inside diameter steel pipe connected together weighing  pounds these two sections of pipe were fastened to the main pipeline the weight of this pipe and the hook block totaled  pounds the two sections of pipe were connected to the main pipeline and were not a freelysuspended load for weight lifting determination as the crane boom was extended the lift exceeded the manufacturers specified  pound load limit capacity at the load radius range of  to  feet the boom extension increased the load radius training and experience donavon r dunblazier victim had  years  months of mining experience all at this mine he had received training in accordance with  cfr part  and had approximately  months experience as a technicianutility heavy equipment operator operating many types of equipment dunblazier had received  hours of crane classroom training  hours of handson training involving the operation of other types of cranes and  hours of actual handson instruction for the subject crane prior to the accident the first time he used the crane in a production lift occurred on the day of the accident henry w sande had  years and  months of mining experience with  years  months experience on the job as a senior operator technician all at this mine he had received training in accordance with  cfr part  and had participated in numerous crane operations including setup and teardown for movement of the pumps and waterlines thomas r swanson had  years and  months of mining experience with  years  months experience on this job as a millwright all at this mine he had received training in accordance with  cfr part  and had participated in numerous setups or teardowns of pumps and waterlines richard c saari had  years and  month of mining experience with  years  months experience on this job as a millwright all at this mine he had received training in accordance with  cfr part  and had participated in the setups and teardowns of the pumps and waterlines michael d long had  months of mining experience with  months experience on the job as a millwright all at this mine he had received training in accordance with  cfr part  this was his first day moving pumps and waterlines root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following root causes were identified root cause management procedures and controls were ineffective and failed to ensure the task trainer remained in the immediate area to closely supervise the trainee during task training sessions corrective action management should implement a procedure to ensure that task trainers always remain in the immediate area of a trainee to maintain close supervision as training and work is conducted root cause management policy and controls were inadequate and did not ensure that crane operators followed correct procedures when making a lift the crane was positioned on a grade without the outriggers and stabilizer jacks being deployed and with underinflated tires corrective action management should implement a policy ensuring that when crane lifts are made outriggers will be used and the crane will be operated within the manufacturers design parameters conclusion the accident occurred because the procedures used to train a person to safely operate a crane were not effective the trainer did not remain in immediate contact at all times while task training the victim the outriggers and stabilizer jacks on the crane were not utilized the weight of the lift exceeded the crane manufacturers design lifting capacity on rubber and the cranes tires were underinflated for lifting on rubber enforcement actions order no  was issued on june   under the provisions of section k of the mine act a fatal accident occurred at the mine on june   when three millwrights and two equipment operators one of which was being trained on the rubbertired crane were attempting to construct the dewatering line along the pipeline access road this order is issued to assure the safety of all persons at this operation it prohibits all activity in the barricaded area around the crane the ph omega crane serial  itself and with the designated sections of waterline until msha has determined that it is safe to resume mining operations in this area the mine operator shall obtain prior approval from an authorized representative for all actions to recover and or restore operations to the affected area the order was terminated on june   the conditions which contributed to the fatal accident no longer exist citation no  was issued on july   under the provisions of section a of the mine act for violation of  cfr aii a fatal accident occurred at this mine on june   when a crane tipped over pinning the miner beneath the cab the victim was being task trained regarding proper operation of the crane the victim was not provided direct and immediate supervision as he performed some aspects of this task the citation was terminated on august   the mine operator established a policy requiring a trainer to remain in immediate contact with a mobile crane trainee at all times during task training work activity will cease if contact is broken citation no  was issued on july   under the provisions of section a of the mine act for violation of  cfr  a fatal accident occurred on june   when a rubbertired crane tipped onto its side and the miner was pinned beneath the cab the lift was being initiated beyond the manufacturers design lifting capacity due to a combination of factors that included a load exceeding the manufacturers specification work from a sloped surface tires that were underinflated and the failure to utilize the outriggers the crane manufacturers design lifting capacity when lifting from the side without outriggers at this radius was  pounds the load being lifted exceeded this weight the citation was terminated on august   the mine operator conducted a meeting with personnel involved in pit dewatering pipeline movement and informed them of the mandatory use of mobile crane outriggers the procedures to relocate pit dewatering pipelines will be reviewed by a certified mobile crane trainer the miners were notified that prior to mobile crane usage the tire pressures must be checked to ensure they are within the manufacturers recommendations related fatal alert bulletin fabm fatality overview powerpoint  pdf appendix a persons

into a dredge pond and drowned he was working alone on the dredge deck possibly attempting to untangle a winch cable he was not wearing a life jacket the accident occurred because management policies and work procedures failed to adequately address the risks associated with working near water company policy did not require employees to wear a life jacket while working inside the hand rails provided around the perimeter of the dredge deck the company did not have a policy or formal procedure relative to working alone on the dredge deck additional considerations that might prevent future accidents include more substantial hand rails on dredges to keep persons from falling into the water providing hand holds and access ladders on the sides of dredges in case someone needs to climb out of the water providing life jackets that will upright an unconscious person after they have fallen into the water and identifying which employees cannot swim so that extra measures of protection can be provided for them general information martin marietta materials inc plant  a sand and gravel dredging operation owned and operated by martin marietta materials inc was located in denham springs st helena parish louisiana the principal operating official was eric buchanan plant manager the mine operated two hour shifts per day five and one half days per week total employment was  persons sand and gravel were dredged and pumped from the pit to the processing plant where the materials were screened and sized the finished product was sold for construction uses the last regular inspection at this operation was completed on september   description of accident on the day of the accident robert spears victim reported for work at  am his normal starting time he traveled to no  dredge and began dredging material alone about  pm spears used his cell phone to call wilson moore no  dredge operator they discussed a number of things including the problem spears was having with a mud seam in the pond until about  pm moore advised spears to work through the mud seam as they usually did by raising and lowering the suction head with the ondeck cable winch spears continued to work and at some point the winch cable became tangled on the winch reel investigators believe that spears tried to untangle the winch cable and may have been struck in the head by a crowbar that he appeared to have been using since he was later found with a contusion on his forehead after working on the tangled winch cable spears apparently made his way about seven feet to the edge of the dredge and fell into the pond even though hand rails were provided at the left side of the dredge where investigators believe he fell spears was wearing blue jeans tshirt and pullon steeltoed boots but not a life jacket his head injury may have rendered him unconscious since the pond scum on the side of the dredge was undisturbed indicating that spears did not attempt to climb out of the water without hand holds or an access ladder on the side of the dredge spears would have had difficulty pulling himself up nearly two feet to get out of the water reportedly spears could swim when spears did not report to shore for shift change about  pm coworkers searched for him they immediately found one of his boots floating near the shore and the shore boat could be seen still tied to the dredge an emergency boat was taken to the dredge the engines were shut off and spears was found near the water jet spray intake at the rear of the dredge about  pm efforts to resuscitate spears were unsuccessful and he was pronounced dead at the scene by the coroner of st helena parish death was attributed to drowning investigation of accident on the day of the accident msha was notified at  pm by a telephone call from eric buchanan plant manager to mshas emergency hotline edward lopez district manager was called and an investigation was started the same day an order was issued pursuant to section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of miners mshas accident investigation team traveled to the mine made a physical inspection of the accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and employees discussion location of accident the accident occurred on no  dredge which was facing generally east in about  feet of water and about  feet from the nearest bank weather conditions at the time of the accident consisted of mostly cloudy skies temperatures that reached  degrees fahrenheit and winds generally from the southeast around  mph with gusts up to  mph investigators believe that spears body drifted from the left side of the dredge to the rear of the dredge due to the wind andor water movement in that general direction no  dredge the dredge was constructed on site several years ago it was about  feet long  feet wide and was equipped with an enclosed control booth a water jet spray inch suction head inch slurry pump one smaller water pump and an ondeck cable winch the dredge had two diesel engines one to power the inch slurry pump and one for all other power needs including the small water pump the two diesel engines and the two pumps were operating when employees arrived at the scene the dredge was kept stationary in the pond by two ropes attached to onshore anchors the ropes could be adjusted to allow the dredge to move one direction or another the small water pump picked up water near the rear of the dredge and directed it to the water jet spray through a water line sand and gravel in the pond were stirred up by the water jet spray drawn into the nearby suction head and suction line then pumped to shore through approximately  feet of pipeline the water jet spray with its associated water line and the suction head with its associated suction line were lowered or raised together in the dredge pond by the ondeck cable winch the total suspended weight was estimated to be about  pounds the dredge deck was equipped with handrails made of various materials including steel rods and cables the section of handrail nearest the accident scene consisted of a inch steel rod positioned  inches above the dredge deck but it was bowed near the middle at the same location there was also a inch steel cable midrail mounted  inches above the dredge deck both were approximately  feet long the handrail was welded to vertical sections of pipe at each end and the midrail was secured at each end by cable clips there were no hand holds or access ladders on the side of the dredge to accommodate persons that might fall into the dredge pond the dredge operators accessed the dredge deck by stepping from the shore boat through an opening in the hand rails at the rear of the dredge dredging process sand and gravel were dredged by lowering the water jet spray and suction head in the pond and moving them along the bottom occasionally mud seams were encountered and made dredging difficult the water jet spray and suction head were repeatedly raised and lowered to punch through the mud seams to reach more sand and gravel while lowering the water jet spray and suction head into the mud the dredge operators would sometimes feed the winch cable faster than the suction head could move that would cause the winch cable to slacken and tangle on the reel creating a condition commonly referred to as a birds nest on average this condition occurred a couple of times per month winch the ondeck winch was a tulsa winch model #sllrfo that was installed about three years ago it was spooled with approximately  feet of inch x imp winch cable the winch had a position selfcentering hand control that operated the screw which powered the winch reel either clockwise or counterclockwise it was not equipped with a selfspooling feature to ensure proper spooling of the cable the hand control required operator presence in the control booth to either feed or spool the cable when the hand control was centered the screw would hold the winch reel stationary by feeding the cable from the winch reel the dredge operator could allow the suction head water jet spray and associated lines to descend under their own weight by spooling the cable the dredge operator could raise the suction head water jet spray and associated lines the winch was tested and no defects were found cable misalignment correction procedure prior to the accident no written procedures were in place for persons to untangle a winch cable however the informal procedure used by dredge operators was to pull all the cable off the winch reel and rewind it with the assistance of another person personal flotation device a type v work vest personal floatation device that had been issued to spears was found on a chair just behind the control booth on the dredge it was not designed to upright an unconscious person training and experience robert spears had  years mining experience and had operated a dredge for ten years he worked at this operation for four weeks and had received training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following root causes were identified root cause management policies and work procedures failed to address working alone on the dredge deck while performing potentially hazardous duties corrective action management should perform a risk assessment to identify those hazardous duties that require the presence and assistance of a second person policies should be established to ensure that employees follow safe work procedures root cause management policies and work procedures failed to identify the hazard of falling into water while working inside the hand rails that were provided around the perimeter of the dredge deck corrective action management should perform a risk assessment to identify and mitigate all hazards associated with the tasks to be performed dredge operators should wear a life jacket while working on the dredge deck conclusion the accident occurred because management policies and work procedures failed to adequately address the risks associated with working on water company policy did not require employees to wear a life jacket while working inside the hand rails provided around the perimeter of the dredge deck the company did not have a

scene interviewed employees and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management employees and the grant county sheriffs department discussion location of the accident the accident occurred near the pipe crossover area of the mine between the quarry and the plant the ground was level and covered with dry gravel the weather was clear with a temperature of approximately  degrees fahrenheit pump barge the pump barge was constructed at the mine and consisted of a  by  deck mounted on several pontoons the deck was made of fiberglass floor grating and provided support for an electric pump with a horsepower motor with a combined weight of  lbs the pontoons were constructed of stainless steel round tubing with flat stainless steel plates welded over each end the two pontoons immediately under the deck were about  feet long and  inches inside diameter one of these pontoons ruptured while johnson was testing it for leaks ruptured pontoon the pontoon that ruptured was divided into three separate chambers two of the chambers were approximately  inches long and the third chamber was approximately  inches long with a wall thickness of approximately  inches the plate at the outside end of the inch chamber was approximately  inches thick and had a inch drain plug near the bottom edge of the plate the drain plug had been replaced by a threaded fitting to accommodate connections to a supply of compressed air the welds securing the plates over the tubing ends were not uniform full penetration welds that would typically be found on a pressure vessel the welds at the outside end of the inch chamber failed under pressure and the plate struck johnson the pontoon was not designed or constructed to be pressurized the pontoon was not equipped with a pressure relief valve to prevent it from being over pressurized air compressor and connections the air compressor was an ingersollrand model xp wjd it was rated at  cubic feet per minute inlet air flow at  pounds per square inch gage psig the compressor manufactured in  was not equipped with an air receiver tank  feet of inch rubber hose rated for

a tfitting was connected to the output side of the valve and a pressure gauge was attached to the tee of the tfitting the tfitting had been connected to a threaded fitting on the pontoon but the force which caused the pontoon to rupture broke the threaded fitting and projected the gauge and valve several feet away from the pontoon part of the threaded fitting was found in the output side of the tfitting the valve was found about twothirds open it had sustained minor damage but was still functional pressure gauge the pressure gauge was a stainless steel safety gauge with a range of  psig it too had sustained minor damage but was still functional the gauge was examined and tested with a calibrated gauge both gauges were attached to the air compressor involved in the accident the gauge involved in the accident indicated  psig while the calibrated test gauge read  psig pontoon leak testing procedure the mine did not have a written procedure to perform leak testing on pontoons mine personnel stated that they generally pressurized the pontoons to between  psig and  psig with an air compressor before observing the pressure gauge for  minutes to determine if the pressure inside the pontoon decreased if a leak was indicated they would apply a soap solution to the pontoon to find the leak calculations performed during the investigation indicated that the ingersollrand air compressor would have pressurized the ruptured pontoon chamber to  psig in  seconds  psig in  seconds and the maximum  psig in  seconds training and experience william s johnson had  months of mining experience and had received training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following causal factor was identified causal factor procedures and controls were inadequate they failed to address the hazard of using compressed air to check the pontoon for leaks corrective action procedures should be developed and implemented that enable persons to safely locate leak points on pontoons alternate pontoon designs ie foam filled pontoons should also be considered thoroughly train employees in safe job procedures and hazard recognition before work begins conclusion the accident occurred because safe work procedures had not been established to check the pontoon for leaks the precautions taken to protect persons from injury when using compressed air were not sufficient the pontoon was not designed or constructed to be pressurized and was not equipped with a pressure relief valve to prevent it from being over pressurized enforcement

engineer originating office mine safety and health administration southeast district  gemini circle suite  birmingham al  michael a davis district manager overview miguel vazquez truck driver age  was fatally injured on july   when the haul truck he was operating in the mine extraction area backed into a water filled pit the accident occurred because safe operating procedures were not established to ensure that the extraction area was safe to resume operations after being flooded and idle an examination of the extraction area was not completed on the previous day or the day of the accident there were no barricades or warning signs installed in mine extraction area to identify the location of the water filled pit and warn miners of the hazard the ground in the area was covered with muddy water and the location of the pit was not visible management did not conduct a risk assessment to identify all possible hazards and establish safe work procedures for the extraction area after the flood and before work commenced general information terrassa sand gravel # an open pit sand and gravel operation owned and operated by terrassa sand gravel inc was located on road pr km  barrio pinas about  miles west of toa alta puerto rico the principal operating official was maximo marcano aggregates operations manager the mine operated one eighthour shift per day five days a week total employment was  persons a dragline was used to dig sand and gravel from the river banks and the pit of the extraction area the material was hauled by trucks to the processing plant where it was screened sized washed and stockpiled finished products were sold for use in the construction industry the last regular inspection at the operation was completed on december   description of accident the accident occurred at the extraction area located along the banks of the la plata river five days prior to the accident management was notified that the locks of a dam located upstream of the mine were going to be opened due to recent heavy rains the extraction area of the mine flooded and production ceased the day before the accident the flood waters receded so management discussed the possibility of returning to the extraction area heriberto reyes mechanic was left in charge to direct the miners about  am maximo marcano aggregates operations manager told reyes by telephone to return to work in the extraction area at  am reyes met with manuel diaz truck driver efrain villanueva excavator operator cesar perez dragline operator and miguel vazquez truck driver victim reyes instructed perez to move the dragline to the pit and start loading trucks he told reyes that the area was not safe because the edge of the pit was obscured by the standing water in the extraction area and could not be seen perez suggested that gravel be placed on the area adjacent to the water filled pit as an indicator of the location of the pit but reyes declined villanueva suggested that he could load trucks with the excavator at the south corner of the pit since it wasnt covered with water reyes agreed and villanueva moved the excavator to the south corner of the extraction area and started loading material into the haul trucks manuel diaz and vazquez worked all day each hauling about  loads of material from the extraction area to the plant on the day of the accident vazquez reported to work at  am his normal starting time vazquez met with other employees at the outside break room and then went to check his assigned haul truck about  am he took villanueva to the excavator parked at the entrance of the extraction area vazquez left villanueva drove his haul truck into the extraction area and parked it near the water filled pit that was the normal loading area prior to the flooding after villanueva inspected the excavator he moved it to the south corner of the extraction area where he had worked the previous day at approximately  am villanueva dug a bucket of material and positioned it in front of the excavator a typical procedure to provide the truck drivers with a reference point to backup into the excavator loading area villanueva saw vazquez start backing his truck into the standing water apparently vazquez was using the trucks rear view mirrors to find the excavator and inadvertently backed into the water filled pit manuel diaz saw the accident and traveled in his haul truck from the accident site to the maintenance shop located approximately ï¿½ mile away he told reyes that the other truck fell inside the pond and that vazquez was missing reyes immediately called marcano on his mobile phone to report the accident marcano arrived shortly and called the police emergency medical personnel and puerto rico police divers arrived at  am and recovered vazquez about three hours later the district attorney pronounced the victim dead at  am death was attributed to drowning investigation of the accident msha was notified of the accident at  am et on july   by a telephone call from sandra cartagena human resources administrator to juan a perez supervisory mine safety and health inspector an investigation was started the same day an order was issued under the provisions of section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners mshas accident investigation team traveled to the mine made a physical inspection of the accident scene conducted interviews and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and employees discussion accident location the accident occurred at the mine extraction area located near the la plata river the area around the accident site was fairly level but muddy the pit and its adjacent area were submerged the water was about five feet from the pits edge at the location where the truck entered the pit the pit had a near vertical drop off and was approximately  feet deep the edge of the pit could not be seen through the muddy water prior to backing into the water filled pit tire tracks indicated the haul truck traveled in a straight direction heading approximately westnorthwest this would have placed the sun behind the driver and over his right shoulder the tire tracks also indicated that as the haul truck was backing up it was articulated to approximately the full left position this would have changed the position of the left side rear view mirror from facing approximately eastsoutheast to facing more eastnortheast the location of the sun at the time of the accident considering the movement of the left side mirror more in the direction of the sun and the convex surface of the mirror which provides a wider view it is possible that the victim may have been temporary blinded or distracted by the suns reflection in the mirror examinations israel diaz mine supervisor was on vacation from july   through the time of the accident and he had assigned heriberto reyes to be in charge of the operation maximo marcano was not at the mine site at the time of the accident no one was assigned to conduct the examinations israel diaz last examined the mine extraction area for hazards on july   weather at the time of the accident the weather was clear with a temperature of  degrees fahrenheit haul truck the haul truck involved in the accident was a caterpillar dd articulated hauler manufactured in  it was approximately  feet long  feet wide and  feet high and had a rated load capacity of  tons the truck had a tractor and a trailer unit the truck was powered by a caterpillar model b six cylinder turbocharged diesel engine the transmission had a forwardneutralreverse selector and a four speed gear selector providing four forward speeds and four reverse speeds the transmission had an integral hydraulic retarder the articulatedframe truck steering was actuated by hydraulic cylinders the truck had sixwheel drive with one axle on the tractor unit and two axles on the trailer the truck was submerged in the water filled pit for six days before being recovered other than water damage from the accident no physical damage was observed on the truck brake system the truck was equipped with service parking and secondary brake systems the service brake system consisted of brake chambers at all six wheels that activated drum and shoe wedge type brakes the tractor brakes were hydraulically applied by an airhydraulic actuator the trailer brakes were applied by air pressure the service brakes were controlled by a foot pedal in the operators compartment independent air supplies were provided to the tractor and trailer brake circuits the parking brake was activated by a parksecondary control handle in the operators compartment when this handle was placed in the park position the spring appliedpressure released parking brake system applied the same drum and shoe wedge brakes on the four trailer wheels as used by the service brake system the parking brakes were released by supplying air pressure to compress the spring the secondary brake system was activated by the parksecondary control handle in the operators compartment when this handle was placed in the secondary position air pressure was supplied to activate the airhydraulic actuator and apply the tractor brakes at the same time it causes air to vent from the parking brake chambers which allows the parking brake springs to apply the brakes on the trailer axles the truck was not equipped with an optional engine brake the haul truck engine was put into running condition following the accident to allow operational brake testing testing of the tractor brakes after its brake system was bled did not reveal any hydraulic leaks or other problems both the parking and service brake met the caterpillar brake holding ability specifications steering system the articulatedmachine frame steering was provided by doubleacting hydraulic steering cylinders that provided  degree left and right steering caterpillar specified an sae turning radius of  the tire tracks at the accident site indicate a turning radius to the left of approximately  the machine was steered nearly to its left steering stop prior to the accident the hydraulic filters for the steering system and other hydraulic functions were removed and inspected no significant accumulation of debris was observed on the filters a steering time test was performed no damaged leakage or operational problems were noted with the steering system seat belt a functional seat belt was provided for the operators seat the belt buckled and unbuckled without difficulty controls the positions of the operators controls were observed after the recovery of the truck the engine start switch key was in the on run position the

received training before operating equipment the victim did not maintain control of the skid steer loader he was operating he was not wearing a seat belt at the time of the accident general information darrel volker construction a surface sand and gravel operation owned and operated by darrel volker construction was located about two miles west of highway  south of auburn nemaha county nebraska the principal operating official was darrel r volker owner the mine was normally operated one hour shift a day five days a week total employment was four persons sand and gravel was extracted from the pit with a frontend loader loaded into haul trucks and transported to the plant the material was dumped into the grizzly screened and stockpiled finished products were sold for use in the construction industry msha had not been notified that this mine was in operation prior to the accident an inspection of the mine was conducted following completion of the fatal investigation description of accident on the day of the accident mark keleel victim reported for work at about  am his scheduled starting time darrel volker told keleel to do clean up around the plant and on the dump site haul road keleel used the skid steer loader to clean up throughout the morning while other employees performed repair and maintenance on equipment after lunch at approximately  pm jerry olson plant operator started the plant a few minutes later olson observed keleel as he dumped a load of sand and gravel into the grizzly with the skid steer loader keleel had previously used a frontend loader to feed the plant this was the first shift keleel used the skid steer loader to dump material into the grizzly at approximately  pm keleel approached the grizzly to dump his second load olson noticed the skid steer loader was traveling fast with the bucket approximately five feet above the ground he yelled to keleel to lower the bucket but the bucket continued to rise as the skid steer loader approached the stop block keleel lost control of the skid steer loader as it traveled forward onto the grizzly overturned and landed on its wheels at the base of the grizzly the initial impact ejected both keleel and the seat from the operators compartment keleel was not wearing a seat belt a tow strap that was stored behind the seat had become entangled around the loaders left steering control lever and caused the control level to engage the skid steer loader rotated  degrees running over keleel who was lying on the ground olson ran to the skid steer loader shut off the engine and told dustin volker son of darrel volker to notify his father of the accident and to summon help emergency personnel arrived a short time later and transported keleel to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead the cause of death was cardiorespiratory arrest attributed to trauma investigation of the accident msha was notified of the accident at  pm mst on april   by a telephone call from bryan drake regional osha representative in kansas city missouri to jake deherrera assistant district manager an investigation was started the next day an order was issued under the provisions of section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners msha accident investigators traveled to the mine made a physical inspection at the accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and employees discussion location of the accident the accident occurred at the dump location for the plant grizzly the dump location consisted of a steel bin the grizzly constructed of steel was  feet  inches wide by  feet  inches long and was positioned at a grade of  percent the front edge of the grizzly extended upward  inches from the ground at the end of the ramp and served as the bumper block at this dump location the top of the grizzly was  feet  inches above the ground the weather was clear and the temperature was approximately  degrees equipment the skid steer loader was a  new holland model no l and was powered by a  horsepower deutz type fl diesel engine the loader was equipped with hydrostatic fourwheel drive and had propulsion and hydrostatic braking that were controlled by two handoperated controls power was transferred from the hydrostatic motors to the front and rear wheels through drive chains the loader had a rated load lifting capacity of  pounds and was equipped with rollover protection and falling object protection ropsfops it was approximately  inches long including the bucket  inches wide and  inches high to the top of the ropsfops structure the wheel base was approximately  inches the loader was equipped with titan  nhs hd  ii tires which was the correct size as specified by new holland the pivot point of the bucket was approximately  feet above the ground with the lift arms fully raised the estimated load in the bucket at the time of the accident was  pounds based on the buckets capacity the density of sandy gravel  lbs cubic yard and witness statements travel and steering were controlled by two hand operated levers on the left and right sides of the operators seat the hydrostatic drive system acted as a service brake to stop the loader when the controls were placed in the neutral position a lever on the right side of the compartment shut down the engine when activated by shutting off the fuel when tested all these systems functioned properly a two position handle on the right side of the operators compartment allowed the operator to select high or low travel speed the maximum rated speed in the low speed position was  mph and the maximum rated speed in the high speed position was  mph the two position highlow speed selector handle was held with a wire in the lowspeed position the wire prevented the handle from being placed in the highspeed position the maximum travel speed of the loader with the control handle in the lowspeed position was clocked at  mph two foot treadles controlled the bucket lift and tilt functions pushing the bottom heel of the left treadle raised the lift arms and pushing on the toe portion lowered the lift arms pushing the bottom heel of the right treadle tilted the bucket backward carry position and pushing on the toe of this treadle tilted the bucket forward dump position upon release these treadles returned to the neutral position and bucket movement stopped the two foot treadles that controlled the bucket lift and tilt functions operated as described in the operators manual the bucket was loaded with a sand and gravel mix the lift arms were raised and lowered and the bucket was tilted up and down no operational defects were observed the engine throttle speed was controlled by a handoperated lever on the left side of the operators compartment when the handle was released it remained in the position it was placed in when tested it functioned properly the loader was designed with a seat switch activated boom lockout feature in the boom lift circuit which prevented boom operation lifting or lowering if the operator was not in the seat the seat switch was connected to an electronic solenoid the seat was bolted to a seat base plate as described in the operators manual the seat assembly was springloaded so the operators weight depressed the seat causing a button switch under the seat to make electrical contact this sent electrical current to a solenoid valve which moved a plunger in a hydraulic valve allowing oil to flow to and from the boom cylinders when tested as described in the operators manual the boomseat switch lockout safety feature did not operate the investigation determined this defect did not contribute to the cause of the accident the loader was equipped with two mechanical boom lock pins that could support the two lift arms in the elevated position when tested they functioned properly the seat was attached to a steel plate approximately  inches wide and  inches long the metal portion of the underside of the seat that bolted to the seat base plate was heavily corroded two  inch long and  inch diameter pins projected from the back end of the seat base plate and fit into two holes at the rear of the operators compartment the front of the seat was held down by two latches the seat was ejected from the machine during the accident after the seat base plate was reinstalled the seat could be pulled free by manually grasping the seat base plate and forcefully pulling in the forward direction this caused the seat base plate to bow upward enough to pull the rear pins out and free the seat based on photographs that were sent to the manufacturer of the machine a new holland engineer stated that the seat base plate was made by new holland but that the seat was not made by new holland the loader was provided with a footapplied caliperdisc parking brake the parking brake application force was transferred from the pedal to a pair of caliperdisc assemblies through mechanical linkage when applied the pedal would lock in position however the mechanical linkage was distorted and the parking brake failed to hold the empty loader on a  percent grade this defect did not contribute to the cause of the accident the seat belt was functional and latched and unlatched when tested it was installed on the machine as described in the operators manual the seat belt was not attached to the seat or seat base plate but was attached to the deck of the operators compartment in the area beside the seat when the seat belt was buckled it held both the operator and the seat in the machine training and experience keleel had been employed for two weeks with eight days on the mine site he had not been given training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following causal factors were identified causal factor no policies procedures or controls were in place to ensure that employees received training to safely operate mobile equipment the victim did not maintain control of the equipment he was operating corrective actions procedures should be established to provide training to employees before they operate mobile equipment causal factor no policies procedures or controls were in place to ensure that employees wear seat belts while operating mobile equipment corrective action procedures should be established to ensure that employees wear seat belts at all times while operating mobile equipment conclusion the accident

and traveled over rough terrain the victim who was not wearing his seatbelt was ejected from the cab of the scraper the accident occurred because the scrapers braking systems were not maintained in a functional condition policies standards and procedures were inadequate because equipment examinations had not been routinely performed and the equipment had not been repaired or removed from service the victim was not wearing a seatbelt to prevent him from being ejected from the cab of the scraper  general information white vulcan mine a surface pumice operation owned and operated by tufflite inc was located  mile west of mile marker  highway  north of flagstaff coconino county arizona the principal operating officials were clarence t morgan president clarence e morgan vicepresident and clay morgan secretary the mine normally operated one  hour shift a day  days a week total employment was  persons pumice was extracted from the pit with a bulldozer a frontend loader transported the material to a crusher the material was crushed screened and stockpiled finished products were sold for use in the construction industry two pits were located at this operation active mining was conducted at one pit and stockpiles were processed and reclamation work was being done at the other pit the accident occurred at the reclaimed pit the last regular inspection of this mine was completed on july   description of the accident on the day of the accident valdis g cody victim reported for work at about  am his normal starting time was  am his duties were to continue with the reclamation project of the old pit cody traveled a  mile loop operating the scraper collecting dirt from one side of a hill and dropping it on the other side of the same hill about  am cody got out of his scraper to talk with nathaniel yellowhorse equipment operator yellowhorse told cody he was going to shut down the plant and was going to operate another scraper to help with the reclamation work cody told yellowhorse he was going to move his car and take an early lunch around  am as yellowhorse was parking his frontend loader he noticed that codys scraper was near a dozer yellowhorse went to check on cody and found him lying on the ground behind the scraper yellowhorse contacted sam wilson mine foreman to tell him about cody wilson and yellowhorse called for emergency medical assistance the victim was pronounced dead at the scene death was attributed to crushing injuries investigation of accident msha was notified of the accident at  am on september   by a telephone call from connie morgan wife of the company vicepresident to pete gutierrez mine safety and health inspector an investigation was started that day an order was issued under the provisions of section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners mshas accident investigators traveled to the mine made a physical inspection of the accident scene conducted interviews and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management employees and the arizona state mine inspectors office discussion location of the accident the accident occurred at the southwest end of the no screen plant area just to the left of the west pit access roadway the roadway was approximately  feet wide and  feet long with an average grade of  percent after the scraper veered off the roadway the terrain along the machines path was rough and included a drop of approximately  inches  degrees grade over  feet this drop was located approximately  feet from the point where the operator started to descend the grade towards the no screen plant area two other drops of  inches and  inches were also noted further along the vehicles path after the victim was ejected the scraper traveled approximately  feet where it made contact with a parked dozer causing it to stop scraper the scraper involved in the accident was a  terex model tsb which was purchased and brought to the mine approximately two months before the accident it was approximately  feet  inches wide  feet  inches long and  feet  inches high the scraper had a capacity of  cubic yards weighed approximately  tons empty and had a maximum weight of approximately  tons loaded the bowl was approximately threequarters full at the time of the accident the scraper was powered by two  hp detroit diesel  cylinder engines one engine powered the tractor portion and the other powered the scraper the diesel engines were connected to automatic transmissions with  forward speeds neutral and reverse the tractor enginetransmission drove the tractors two wheels and the scrapers enginetransmission drove the scrapers two wheels separate accelerator pedals controlled the two engines but one transmission gear selector controlled both transmissions the engines were reported to be running when the first rescuers arrived at the scene both engines were tested during the investigation no problems were noted with the engines or their throttle controls only the tractors engine provided hydraulic power for the steering system and compressed air for the braking system braking system the braking system was inspected investigators found that there were defects present prior to the accident that reduced the braking ability of the scraper at the time of the accident only the left rear brake showed evidence of producing significant braking on the left rear brake assembly the service brake air line was connected but the emergencypark brake lock air supply line was not connected brake chamber lock port open the push rod was not locked in place indicating that the emergencypark brake lock was defective with the application of the service brake at  pound per square inch psi air pressure the push rods stroke was measured at approximately  inches these chambers were designed to provide a  inch stroke at a measured stroke of  inches this chamber exceeded its maximum design stroke by  inches the clean surface of the brake drum indicated that some braking force was still being developed at this wheel on the left front brake assembly there was no push rod or clevis coming out of the brake safety chamber or a slack adjuster present to apply the brakes there were no brake shoe assemblies present inside the brake drum the left front brake was completely inoperative the build up of dirt on the components indicated that these defects were present prior to the accident on the right front brake assembly there were no air lines connected to the brake chamber paint on the chambers service brake and emergencypark brake lock fittings indicated that the air lines had not been present at the time of the accident the service brake air line on the right rear brake assembly was connected but the emergencypark brake lock air supply line was not connected brake chamber lock port open the push rod was not locked in place indicating that the emergencypark brake lock was defective with application of the service brake at  psi air pressure the push rods stroke was measured at approximately  inch the clevis attaching the push rod to the slack adjuster was broken missing the arms that hold the clevis pin and connected it to the slack adjuster the clevis pin was present in the slack adjuster the push rods broken clevis still contacted and moved the slack adjuster but there was no movement of the brake shoes the brake drum was packed with dirt there were no clean surfaces on the brake drum indicating that no braking force was being developed at this wheel the build up of dirt indicated that the defects found at this wheel were present prior to the accident an air compressor provided compressed air to the brake systems three reservoirs the rear air reservoir was disconnected from the braking system the air compressors governor was designed to maintain the air pressure between a maximum of  psi and a minimum of  psi when tested with the engine at idle and the service brakes applied the air pressure dropped from approximately  psi to  psi in  seconds  psimin the investigators noted air leaks at the left front brake chamber both rear brake chambers and at the service brake pedal when tested with the engine running at idle and the parking brake applied the brake system air pressure dropped from approximately  psi to  psi in  seconds  psiminute air leaks were noted at the left front brake chamber and near the reservoir relief valve and pressure switch when tested the emergencypark brake system automatically actuated both rear brake chambers when the air pressure dropped to approximately  psi automatic application at approximately  psi per terex specification only the left rear brake actually applied and neither brake chambers push rod locking mechanism held the push rod in the applied position the scraper was equipped with a low airpressure warning horn if the brake system started to lose air pressure the horn was to activate as a warning when the pressure dropped to between  psi and  psi if the pressure to the brake chamber lock ports dropped below approximately  psi the brake chambers were designed to lock in the applied position the next time the brakes were applied any time the air pressure dropped to  psi the brakes automatically applied the brakes would be fully applied if the pressure dropped to  psi when tested the horn did not sound as the air pressure dropped from  to  psi the low airpressure warning horn for the brake system did not function as required the scraper was also equipped with a steering brake lever mounted on the steering column this brake was used to only apply either the left or right tractor not scraper wheel brake in order to maneuver duck walk out of slippery or soft material or to make sharp turns scraper operators cab the scraper was equipped with a rollover protective structure there were no doors or windows attached to the cab inside the cab three spokes of the steering wheel were broken the steering wheel was bent downward below the level of its center hub the lever for a hand brake valve also referred to as a steering brake typically was attached to the left side of the steering wheel column this lever broke off and was found on top of the scrapers hood approximately  inches forward of the hand brake valve both the steering wheel and the hand brake lever appeared to have broken during the accident the operators compartment was provided with a functional air cushioned seat that had approximately  inches of vertical travel because the scrapers axles were rigidly mounted to the frame the movement of the operators seat provided the only means to cushion the impact the seatbelt that was provided in the cab functioned normally when tested the operators compartment was clean and did not contain any items that might have interfered with the operation of the scraper weather the weather at the time of the accident was partly cloudy skies and windy with gusts up to  mph and a temperature of approximately  degrees fahrenheit medical analysis the toxicology laboratory report found the victims blood alcohol level to be  percent this level exceeded arizonas impairment level and may have contributed to the accident training and experience valdis cody had been employed intermittently at the mine for approximately  years and had received training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following causal factors were identified causal factor management policies standards and controls were inadequate and failed to implement corrective actions in a timely manner repairs had not been made to the braking systems on the scraper before it was placed into service corrective actions procedures should be established requiring that all mobile equipment is inspected prior to being placed in service selfpropelled mobile equipment with brake defects should be removed from service and tagged to prohibit use until the defects are corrected causal factor management policies failed to ensure that mobile equipment operators recognize the hazards associated with operating mobile equipment without a functional braking system corrective actions mobile equipment operators should be trained to identify all safety defects procedures should be implemented to repair any defects that effect safety or remove equipment from service until the repairs are made causal factor management did not ensure that mobile equipment operators were wearing seatbelts when operating mobile equipment corrective actions management should develop and implement a written seatbelt policy to ensure seatbelts are worn when operating selfpropelled mobile equipment and regularly monitor equipment operators for seatbelt usage causal factor standards policies and controls were inadequate management failed to implement a procedure to recognize alcohol use on mine property corrective action management should develop and implement a procedure for recognizing alcohol use on mine property conclusion the accident occurred because the scrapers braking systems were not maintained in a functional condition policies standards and procedures were inadequate because equipment examinations had not been routinely performed and the equipment had not been repaired or removed from service the victim was not wearing a seatbelt to prevent him from being ejected from the cab of the scraper enforcement actions order no  was issued on september   under the provisions of section k of the mine act a fatal accident occurred at this

of the rear half on the screw jacks and the rear portion with caterpillar support stands wheel chocks were placed behind the right rear tire and in front of the left rear tire penatzers duties required performing a work place examination in the mine shop prior to removal of the right and left steering rams from their cylinders he also performed a job hazard analysis and started to remove the right cylinder penatzer completed the removal of the right cylinder barrel dewes helped penatzer set the ram onto a used oil cart placed below the loader frame the used oil cart was moved to the left side of the front end loader to repeat the process on the left steering cylinder penatzer started working on the left cylinder and removed the left jack to give the used oil cart access under the loader frame to catch the leaking oil kelly springerley heavy equipment mechanic saw penatzer pulling the ram from the left cylinder springerley helped hold and pull the cylinder and placed it on the used oil cart and removed it from the work area shortly before  am essig came to discuss the condition of the cylinders with penatzer after essig left schafer was standing by the frontend loaders left side access ladder he stretched grabbing the ladder and pulled down the loader moved and schafer asked penatzer if he had also seen the loader move penatzer confirmed he had and that he had pulled the left jack out of place to get the used oil cart in under the frame to catch the oil coming from the cylinder as the ram was extracted schafer reminded penatzer to replace the jack as soon as possible at  am both men then went to lunch until  am penatzer then returned after lunch to finish removing the left steering cylinder from the frame the steering cylinder pin was situated behind the left rear tire penatzer was talking to dewes as he stepped onto the bottom rung of the operators access ladder and grabbed onto the lower handrail attached to the operators platform to get positioned in the opening over the wheel below the left rear fender frame as he slid into the opening his weight was sufficient to change the center of gravity of the frontend loader causing the right rear tire to roll forward and the left front portion to drop to the floor the opening between the tire and the fenderframe closed wedging penatzers body between the tire and the fenderframe mechanics working in the area responded and used the overhead crane to extricate penatzer mine personnel administered first aid until local emergency personnel arrived penatzer was transported to a local medical center where he was pronounced dead by the attending physician the cause of death was multiple blunt force trauma investigation of the accident msha was notified of the accident at  pm on january   by a telephone call from david chavez rinker west division safety director to david brown supervisory mine safety and health inspector an investigation was started the same day an order was issued under the provisions of section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of miners mshas accident investigation team traveled to the mine conducted a physical inspection of the accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management employees and the arizona state mine inspectors office discussion location of the accident the accident occurred in the east end heavy equipment bay of the mechanic shop this shop bay was accessed from the north side of the building the floor was dry at the time of the accident frontend loader the frontend loader involved in the accident was a  caterpillar model c that weighed approximately  pounds the frontend loader had an articulated frame and was powered by a sixcylinder caterpillar diesel engine the bucket unit was on the front half of the loader and the engine unit was on the rear section the engine unit was  feet inches long from the rear bumper to the center line of the articulation pin and  feet inches wide over the tires the axle on the engine unit was attached to the frame with a trunnion assembly that allowed the axle to oscillate   degrees as specified by caterpillar after the accident the rear half of the machine was found with the wheels on the ground the unit was tilted fully forward with the articulation joint area resting on the shop floor the machine frame had rotated to the left on the oscillation trunnion the space between the rearleft tire and fuel tank closed when the frame rotated to the left on the trunnion the victim was pinned in this area the front half was positioned several feet in front of the engine unit and had no effect on the stability of the engine unit support stands and jacks the rear area of the engine unit was supported by two caterpillar adjustable height support stands each support stand was rated at  tons for up to a inch height the support tube had a series of holes in it so a locking pin could be inserted to lock the tube at selected heights into the base of the support stand two ton screw jacks were used to support the front of the engine unit in the articulation area marks on the underside of the machine indicated that the probable locations of the jacks and support stands at the time of the accident were as follows the rearleft caterpillar support stand was  inches from the back end of the machine and  inches from the left side of the machine the rearright caterpillar support stand was  inches from the back end and  inches from the right side the frontright screw type jack was  inches to the right of the articulation joint center line and  inches back from the front tip of the frame at the articulation area the frontleft screw type jack was found standing against the frontleft tire on the engine unit this jack had been removed to provide space for a three feet by four feet oil waste container under the steering cylinder to prevent spillage on the floor both screw type jacks were set at  inches total length the rearleft caterpillar jack stand was set at  inches total length and the rearright caterpillar jack stand was set at  inches total length investigation tests initially the frame of the machine was lifted to a level position and secured with an overhead crane the two rear support stands and the two front screw jacks were placed under the machine at the approximate locations they were at the time of the accident when the overhead crane lowered the machines frame the left side of the articulation area also lowered this caused the machine frame to tilt to the left on the oscillation trunnion as it did when the accident occurred indicating that the unit was not stable in this configuration to more closely duplicate the conditions at the time of the accident all the jacks were set at the same heights and placed at the probable locations they were at the time of the accident using the marks under the machine the frontleft articulation area was left unsupported as it was reported to be at the time of the accident the unit was secured in position with an overhead crane when the overhead crane was lowered to allow slack in the support cable the frontend of the unit did not visibly drop however the rearright portion of the engine unit lifted onehalfinch away from the rearright jack stand indicating marginal stability the frontright jack and the rearleft support stand remained in contact with the frame of the machine for comparison when this test was repeated with the frontright screw jack adjusted to be  inches more than it was at the time of the accident  inches in length both rear support stands as well as the frontright jack remained in contact with the machine frame without the overhead crane support these tests showed that a small amount of force would be needed to tilt the frontend loader forward or rearward from a balanced position as the amount of tilt increased the amount of force needed to push the unit back would increase as the center of gravity shifted caterpillar instructions the caterpillar disassembly and assembly instructions for separation of loader main frames described the method to support the engine unit when it was separated from the bucket unit this method required woodblocking to be placed under the front of the main frame of the engine unit and two support stands to be placed under the rear portion of the engine unit the caterpillar instructions also required wood blocks to be placed between the rear main frame and the axle housing on both sides of the machine to prevent sidetoside oscillating movement of the machine training and experience christopher m penatzer had  years mining experience all at this mine he had received training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following root causes were identified root cause the victim failed to recognize the hazard associated with working on an improperly blocked frontend loader corrective actions follow the manufacturers procedures to block the frontend loader to ensure that persons performing the work are adequately protected root cause management failed to use oversight to ensure the job safety analysis procedure to safely block the frontend loader was followed corrective action employees and management should be trained to stop look analyze and manage slam each task to evaluate possible hazards and ensure steps are taken to safely perform the task conclusion the accident occurred because procedures to properly block the frontend loader from hazardous motion were not followed enforcement actions order no  was issued on january   under the provisions of section k of the mine act a fatal accident occurred at this operation on january   when a frontend loader fell on a mechanic working in the mine shop an oral k order was issued to the company at  pm on january   this order is issued

replacing tires on a wheel loader he was pinned under the loader when it fell off two supporting hydraulic jacks the accident occurred because policies and procedures failed to ensure that persons could safely perform the task of changing tires on a wheel loader the loader was not adequately blocked against hazardous motion general information texas stone products inc a surface dimension sandstone operation owned and operated by  texas stone products inc was located  miles south of lometa lampasas county texas the principal operating official was william b davis president the mine operated one hour shift  days per week total employment was  persons sandstone was mined from the quarry using wheel loaders and an excavator the mined material was sized by hand and various mechanical methods then palletized the final products were sold commercially holland sons tire a tire service from lampasas texas was owned by curtis holland one employee helped holland repair and replace tires usually on overtheroad trucks mine management called holland to repair a tire on a wheel loader the last regular inspection at this operation was completed on may   description of the accident curtis holland victim and christopher sims helper went to the mine the afternoon of april   to replace a tire on the wheel loader matthew simmons service supervisor directed them to the waste disposal area of the mine where the wheel loader was parked with a flat left front tire holland started the loader and dumped some waste material from the bucket he used the bucket to lift the front of the loader and a jack was placed under the front axle after removing the rim locking ring and breaking the tire loose from the rim holland determined that the tire was not repairable management decided to replace all four tires on the loader so holland and sims left to order them on the day of the accident april th holland and sims arrived about  pm to replace the tires they went directly to the loader and replaced the left front tire without incident they placed a hydraulic jack under the left rear axle removed the valve stem from the left rear tire and then went to work on the right rear tire while the left rear tire deflated a hydraulic jack was placed under the right rear axle to lift the right side and the valve stem was removed from the right rear tire the left rear tire was deflated so holland and sims removed the locking ring from the left rear tire rim and snapped a large set of locking pliers onto the outer tire ring at both the three oclock and nine oclock positions a inch link chain was wrapped around the nose of each set of locking pliers the other end of each chain was attached to a pound capacity cable comealong that was also attached to the rear bumper of hollands service truck the comealong was tightened to exert pressure in an attempt to break the tire from the rim this method would not break the bead so holland crawled under the left rear of the loader and positioned a portable hydraulic tire bead breaker where the tire contacted the rim sims stood behind the left rear tire and operated the foot pedal of the bead breaker holland repositioned the bead breaker twice before the tire separated from the inner rim the rear of the loader immediately shifted toward the right side fell from the jacks supporting it and pinned holland sims used his cell phone to call for emergency medical assistance then checked holland for a pulse but he was nonresponsive sims got another hydraulic jack from the service truck and tried unsuccessfully to lift the rear of the loader off holland mine employees heard the loader fall and sims yelling martin jasso production supervisor used his cb radio to call the mine office for help another loader equipped with forks was used to lift the wheel loader off holland he was pronounced dead at the scene by the justice of the peace death was attributed to blunt force trauma investigation of the accident on the day of the accident msha was notified at  pm by a telephone call from william b davis president to mshas emergency hotline edward lopez district manager was called and an investigation was started the same day an order was issued pursuant to section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of miners mshas accident investigation team traveled to the mine made a physical inspection of the accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and employees discussion location of the accident the accident occurred at a waste disposal area of the mine the ground in the area was dry hardpacked and sloped about one and one half percent downhill from south to north the sky was clear and visibility was good wheel loader the wheel loader involved in the accident was a case model c it weighed  pounds and had a rated bucket capacity heaped of  cubic yards the left rear tire being removed was a r type a vsteel traction radial the tire was  inches in diameter fit on a inch rim and weighed about  pounds service truck hollands service truck was a ford f pickup equipped with a utility bed panels on each side of the bed provided lockable storage a small compressor mounted behind the truck cab was used to provide air pressure for lifting jacks the tire bead breaker and tire inflation tires could be placed in the middle of the open truck bed the service truck was parked about  feet from the loader in a parallel position facing east on the south side of the loader the truck was positioned so the comealong could be attached to the rear bumper tire bead breaker the tire bead breaker was a model  esco air over hydraulic device designed for use on one two and threepiece truck rims without first removing them from the truck when properly positioned it would break a truck tire from the rim in seconds using  pounds of force compressed air was provided to the bead breaker through a foot pedal and an foot section of high pressure hose hydraulic jacks twentyton airoverhydraulic bottle jacks were placed under the left and right rear axles of the loader each jacks base was  inches by  inches and the round head was  inches in diameter the jack under the left rear axle had been placed on a wooden block  inches high by  inches wide by  inches long the jack under the right rear axle had been placed on a wooden block  inches high by  inches wide by  inches long after the accident the height base to the head of the extended cylinder of each jack was  inches each of them was equipped with dual springs positioned to retract the cylinder into the jack housing when the hydraulic pressure was released when tested each jack remained in the extended position until the pressure was released no defects were found with either jack training and experience curtis holland had eight years experience repairing and replacing tires christopher sims had worked with holland for two weeks but had not changed a loader tire prior to the accident holland and sims had not been given sitespecific hazard awareness training as required by  cfr part  it was determined this violation did not contribute to the cause of this accident and the operator was issued a noncontributory citation root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following root cause was identified root cause policies and procedures were inadequate potential hazards were not addressed before performing the task of changing tires on a wheel loader procedures were not established to ensure the wheel loader was blocked against hazardous motion corrective action contractors should establish policies and procedures to ensure that tasks are safely completed any potential hazards associated with their tasks should be thoroughly addressed repairs to mobile equipment should not be made until it is blocked against hazardous motion conclusion the accident

fatally injured on june   while starting to repair a hydraulic line on a frontend loader that was parked outside of the shop he was underneath the raised boom loosening a hydraulic connection when the boom arms fell pinning him against the frame the accident occurred because there were no procedures in place to block the raised components of the frontend loader against hazardous motion to protect persons performing maintenance tasks the victim was not provided any task training prior to repairing a hydraulic line on the frontend loader general information the  mine a surface multibench quarry owned and operated by rockbridge stone products inc was located in glasgow rockbridge county virginia the principal operating official was james e coffey vice president the mine normally operated one hour shift five days per week total employment was ten persons limestone was blasted from multiple benches and transported by frontend loaders and haul trucks to the crushing plant where it was broken and separated into various sized materials finished products were sold as construction aggregate the last regular inspection at this operation was completed on february   description of accident on the day of the accident gary w hostetter victim reported to work at  am his normal starting time timothy galford superintendent assigned hostetter to work with alvin sensabaugh production foreman they were to repair a hydraulic leak on a frontend loader alvin sensabaugh arrived at  am and observed the loader parked in front of the shop with the bucket raised he went into the break room where the employees had assembled and met with jeffery kulp welder both men went outside to the loader and walked under the unblocked raised bucket assembly where alvin sensabaugh showed kulp which hydraulic line needed removed the two men were walking away from the loader when hostetter asked kulp to be shown which hydraulic line was leaking because he wanted to start removing the line kulp took hostetter to the loader to show him which line was leaking after meeting with galford alvin sensabaugh told kulp to go to the quarry because the breaker plates in the crusher needed to be flipped kulp gave hostetter tools so he could remove the hydraulic line kulp and alvin sensabaugh then went to the quarry about  am the other employees left the break room to perform their normal duties anthony sensabaugh machineplant operator was in the shop and had just finished talking with michael cox trackhoe operator and darrell bane haul truck driver he heard the sound of fluid hitting the ground and turned to see the frontend loaders bucket fall to the ground bane asked if anyone was under the bucket and anthony sensabaugh replied that hostetter was there anthony sensabaugh and bane ran to the loader calling for hostetter but there was no response anthony sensabaugh asked cox to raise the bucket but cox didnt think it would raise so they called for emergency medical assistance anthony sensabaugh told alvin sensabaugh and galford of the accident they rushed to the scene and saw that cox was able to curl the loader bucket up enough to free hostetter at  am the first emergency crew arrived at the shop and found hostetter nonresponsive hostetter was pronounced dead at the scene by the responding emergency medical personnel the cause of death was attributed to crushing injuries investigation of the accident msha was notified of the accident at  am on june   by a telephone call from susan coffey office manager to dale st laurent supervisory mine safety and health inspector an investigation was started that day an order was issued under the provisions of section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of miners mshas accident investigation team traveled to the mine made a physical inspection of the accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management employees and personnel from the virginia department of mines minerals and energys division of mineral mining discussion location of the accident the accident occurred near the onsite maintenance shop the weather was cloudy and cool with a temperature of ï¿½ fahrenheit there had been significant rainfall the night before the accident frontend loader the frontend loader that was involved in the accident was a  volvo model lc wheel loader powered by a volvo model tdkce diesel engine the operating weight of the loader was approximately  pounds it had a bucket lifting frame that weighed more than  pounds and was moved by two doubleacting cylinders one on each side of the machine the frontend loader was equipped with a servo assisted pilot operated open center type hydraulic system with a working pressure of approximately  psi a lift control lever raised and lowered the bucket on the frontend loader a bucket tilt lever controlled the bucket tilt position both of these levers were located on the right side console in the operators cab the lift lever had four positions lifting neutral lowering and floating when the lifting control lever was moved it sent a signal to position a fiveway four position hydraulic valve when the control lever was applied this valve allowed hydraulic oil to move the two lifting cylinders to raise or lower the bucket the victim was attempting to remove a steel hydraulic line this line was part of the feed line that went to the cap end of the left lift cylinder one end of the line was connected to the fiveway four position hydraulic valve via a four bolt oring flange at the time of the accident the victim had completely removed three of the four allen head screws holding this connection the fourth screw was found loose and not quite hand tight the other end of the hydraulic line was connected to a hose assembly by a four bolt oring flange the four hexagon screws holding this connection were still tight at the time of the accident this hose assembly went directly to the cap end of the left lift cylinder the bucket lift function operated as designed when the bucket was raised and the machine was turned off hydraulic pressure in the lift cylinder feed lines kept the bucket raised when the victim broke the seal of the hydraulic feed line pressure to the lift cylinders was released and the bucket immediately dropped the hydraulic system was found to function as designed simulated test a simulated test was performed to determine the effect of the release of the lift cylinders on the raised bucket of the frontend loader the bucket was raised the engine was turned off and the lift control lever was moved to allow oil to release from the lift cylinders in this simulation the bucket fell to the ground in less than three seconds however this simulation did not completely depict the accident since the hydraulic pressure could not release as fast as it did during the accident because of line restrictions in the accident the bucket would have dropped much faster and would not have given the victim any time to react volvo service manual mine management was unable to provide a service manual for the machine a local authorized volvo dealer provided a copy of a service manual for the investigators section  of the manual covered repairs to the hydraulic system this section included drawings of tools referred to as etools which could be made for use during hydraulic repairs one of these tools was a lifting frame support referred to as e this support was designed to secure the lifting frame the manual specified always use a support to secure the lifting frame when work is carried out under the lifting frame and referred to a figure showing support e training and experience gary w hostetter had  year and  weeks of mining experience all at this mine he had received annual refresher training in accordance with  cfr part  however he had not received the required task training in accordance with  cfr part a root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following root causes were identified root cause a risk assessment to determine all possible hazards and to establish safe work procedures was not conducted prior to repairing a hydraulic line on a frontend loader no procedures were in place to ensure that persons could safely perform maintenance tasks on mobile equipment the raised components of the frontend loader were not blocked to prevent hazardous motion corrective actions procedures should be established that require a risk assessment be conducted to identify and correct potential hazards associated with the task to be performed safe maintenance procedures should be developed and implemented that ensure components are

road and overturned jones was not wearing a seat belt at the time of the accident the accident occurred because management policies and procedures failed to ensure that all braking systems on the truck were maintained in a functional condition the truck was traveling with defective brakes on a grade steeper than that recommended by the manufacturer berms were not maintained along the elevated portions of the road the failure of the driver to wear a seat belt contributed to the severity of his injuries general information brushy creek mine and mill an underground leadzinc mine owned and operated by doe run company was located at bunker reynolds county missouri the principal operating official was robert w roscoe general manager the mine operated multiple shifts  hours a day  days per week total employment was  persons leadzinc ore was mined underground and hoisted to the surface the ore was milled on site to form a concentrate the finished product was shipped to a smelter where it was refined for a variety of industrial uses mill tailings were pumped behind a dam located about one mile from the mill a remediation crew was raising the level of the dam using broken rock from a local quarry the crew was employed by doe run company but was not permanently assigned to the mine the crew consisted of a project coordinator a lead man and three haul truck drivers james jones was one of the haul truck drivers they had been working at the mine for two weeks the last regular inspection at this operation was completed on february   description of accident on the day of the accident james jones victim reported for work at  am his normal starting time he was assigned to haul broken rock from the mine stockpile to the toe of the tailings dam a distance of about  miles the haul truck jones intended to drive had a flat tire so he performed other tasks until the truck was ready about  am he began hauling using a route that included a stretch of road constructed and used the previous day jones was making a round trip in about  minutes and made  or  trips before taking a lunch break at noon about  pm jones started hauling again and made another  or  trips about  pm anthony parry haul truck driver noticed jones at the top of an approximate foot grade approaching the dam the truck jones was driving appeared to be gaining speed as it descended the grade the truck left the road at a righthand curve and rolled down the steep side slope of the road parry went to the stockpile area to notify karl payne excavator operator and lead man about the accident payne contacted the maintenance shop and asked for help employees responded and found the haul truck on its left side and partially submerged in a seep pond near the toe of the tailings dam jones was submerged in the water and was not found until about  pm when employees partially drained the pond jones torso was in the truck cab and his legs were outside pinned beneath the engine compartment investigators determined that he was ejected through the trucks windshield a ramp of broken rock was constructed to facilitate raising the truck off jones the reynolds county coroner pronounced jones dead about  pm the cause of death was crushing injuries investigation of the accident msha was immediately notified of the accident through allen govero mine safety and health inspector who was conducting a spot inspection and had just exited the underground mine govero notified robert seelke supervisory mine safety and health inspector at  pm and an investigation was started the same day an order was issued pursuant to section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners an accident investigation team from msha traveled to the mine made a physical inspection of the accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and employees discussion location of the accident the accident occurred at the south side of the main tailings dam skies were clear to partly cloudy and the ground conditions were dry travel route and road two trucks were loaded by excavator with broken rock from a stockpile located about  feet southwest of the mill the trucks traveled about  miles from the stockpile to the main tailings dam they then went down an approximate foot section of road constructed on the outside slope of the southwest portion of the dam this section of road had grades ranging from  percent before leveling out about  feet above the toe of the dam at this point the trucks traveled through a sharp right turn and continued level along the outside slope of the dam at the northwest end of the dam the trucks made a sharp left turn down the outside slope to dump at the base of the dam on the return trip trucks traveled up the outside slope of the dam to a road near the top making a sharp right turn and traveling a level road the length of the dam after reaching the far southeast end of the dam the trucks traveled to the stockpile the accident occurred at the sharp righthand turn above the toe of the dam the road in that area was constructed of rock and mill tailings placed on the slope of the dam the road was about  feet wide in the vicinity of the accident but no berm was provided along the outer edge where it dropped off to the toe of the dam haul truck the haul truck involved in the accident was an articulated  wheel moxy offroad model mts it consisted of a cab section and trailer section totaling about  feet long  feet wide and  feet high the truck weighed about  tons and was designed for a maximum payload of  tons it would have had an estimated loaded weight of about  tons based on the typical load hauled the truck was powered by a horsepower cylinder diesel engine investigators were unable to start the engine for full testing because the truck was extensively damaged the mirrors air cleaner wiring hoses exhaust piping right front wheel suspension tandem housing for the left rear wheels steering wheel and shaft and the engine mounts were all damaged as a result of the accident the truck was equipped with an electronically controlled automatic transmission with six forward gears and one reverse gear when the gear shift lever was placed in d the transmission would automatically shift between the six forward gears in accordance with the truck speed and engine revolutions per minute when placed in st nd or rd gear the transmission would not automatically shift into another gear investigators used a moxy transmission testing unit and found several problems with the transmission that were determined to be caused by the accident the truck was equipped with an engine brake exhaust retarder consisting of a valve in the exhaust pipe that was designed to close whenever the accelerator pedal was released this created back pressure to slow the engine and with the transmission in gear and the transmissions torque converter lockup engaged slowed the truck and prevented shifting to a higher gear the operators manual for the truck indicated that it could travel safely on a maximum grade of  percent with a gross weight of  tons and the transmission in first gear the engine brake capacity would be insufficient to control the truck speed if these parameters were exceeded the transmission testing unit was used to simulate activation of the engine brake allowing investigators to determine that the exhaust pipe valve would not close after removing and reinstalling an electrical plug leading to the brake valve the exhaust pipe valve worked consistently upon retesting since there was no damage to the exhaust pipe valve or associated components investigators concluded that the engine brake was not functional at the time of the accident the service brake system consisted of air over hydraulic operated calipers and discs at each of the six wheels the front wheels had two calipers each and the other four wheels had one caliper each the front and rear circuits were separate with their own air and fluid reservoirs the entire braking system was activated by pushing one foot pedal in the truck cab investigators determined that the service brakes were functional at the time of the accident but may have suffered some loss of effectiveness since other employees reported the smell of overheated brakes afterward the parking brake system consisted of a springapplied airreleased caliper and disc on the trailer section drive shaft that was activated by a lever in the cab investigators found the parking brake set and determined that it was functional at the time of the accident discoloration and warping of the disc led them to conclude that it had been very hot the truck was equipped with a certified rollover protective structure rops and operators seat belt the rops had been modified by welding a pipe to it for fire extinguisher storage the seat belt latched and unlatched without difficulty and retracted and locked properly when tested the victim was not wearing the seat belt at the time of the accident training and experience james jones had  year and  weeks experience operating haul trucks for doe run company at various project sites some of the sites were under the jurisdiction of msha and others were not jones worked at this operation for two weeks but had not received training in accordance with  cfr part  he had previously received training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was performed and the following root causes were identified root cause work policies and procedures were inadequate and failed to ensure that all braking systems on the haul truck were maintained in a functional condition corrective action management should initiate policies and procedures to ensure that all mobile equipment is inspected by the equipment operator before being placed in operation and that all safety defects are repaired in a timely manner root cause work policies and procedures were inadequate and failed to ensure that a haul truck was operated on grades compatible with the trucks specifications the operators manual indicating appropriate grades for various payloads was not available on the truck corrective action management should provide an operators manual for all mobile equipment and

stepped into a trench excavated into the side of the slope when a vertical wall collapsed pinning him between two large pieces of clay the accident occurred because procedures were not in place to ensure that persons could work safely at the reclamation site ground conditions that created a hazard were not taken down or supported before work or travel was permitted the area was not posted or barricaded to prevent entry general information felton quarry a surface crushed stone operation owned by granite construction co was located in felton santa cruz county california the principal operating official was eric w gaboury plant superintendent the mine normally operated one hour shift per day five days a week total employment was  persons broken partially decomposed granite was extracted from the quarry by ripping and pushing with a dozer the material was crushed washed screened and stockpiled finished products were sold for use in the construction industry the mine operator was performing work to remediate and reclaim an old overburdened spoil fill area on a hillside the slope of the spoil fill was being flattened and underdrains were being installed as recommended by an engineering firm the last regular inspection at this operation was completed on february   description of accident on the day of the accident clark gamble victim larry g kay compactor operator don r brown dozer operator and ronald g murphy project superintendent started work at  am with a safety talk and a meeting to discuss the days work the crew used a hydraulic excavator to excavate a large sloped hole in a foot wide bench of compacted fill to expose the end of an inch diameter perforated drain line a foot section of drain line was attached with a coupling to the exposed end of drain line and laid against the side of the hole the hole was filled and compacted over the top of the pipe another hole was dug to expose the end of the foot section of pipe and a  feet wide trench was excavated in the slope an  to  feet long section was then coupled and laid into the trench kay was using a mobile compactor to compact the fill on the bench when he saw some dust near the excavated trench and noticed gamble pinned by falling material he yelled to murphy who had just returned from the mine office they tried to move a piece of material pinning gamble but were unsuccessful murphy called for emergency medical assistance he also called david a locatelli plant foreman and then told kay to call brown to help murphy got a shovel and the men worked together to free gamble brown and murphy performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation until the paramedics arrived gamble was pronounced dead at the scene by the santa cruz county coroner the cause of death was attributed to blunt force trauma investigation of accident the mine safety and health administration was notified of the accident a  am on june   by a telephone call from william r jackson director of safety to the national call center karonica glover assistant district manager was called and an investigation was started the same day an order was issued under the provisions of section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners mshas accident investigation team traveled to the mine conducted a physical inspection of the accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management employees and the county coroners office discussion location of the accident the accident occurred at the face of a bench cut into old overburden spoil fill on a hillside the spoil fill had been placed at a slope of about ï¿½ feet horizontal to  foot vertical with a total vertical height of approximately  feet and had exhibited a prior history of instability the ongoing remediation and reclamation of the slope consisted of placing compacted fill at a flatter  feet horizontal to  foot vertical slope over the old fill slope and installing underdrains in the slope the new fill was keyedin to the old fill by cutting benches into the underlying old fill slope as the fill was brought up at the time of the accident a near vertical soil face for the most recently cut bench rose about  to  feet above the elevation of the fill being placed a short notchlike trench had been excavated into the soil face the short trench excavation was used to install one of the two inch flexible corrugated slotted underdrain pipes placed into the old fill which were being installed to run straight down the slope in order to place the pipe at a depth where it would effectively drain the fill the notchlike trenches were excavated into the near vertical faces of the benches cut into the old fill slope a specific procedure was used to extend the drain pipes upslope as the new fill was being placed procedure  unearthing the capped end of the buried pipe from within the notch trench cut into the previously filled bench face  adding additional length or lengths of pipe with couplings then  throwing the lengthened pipe into a new upslope notch trench excavated into the face of the bench currently being filled weather at the time of the accident the weather was clear and dry with temperatures about  to  degrees fahrenheit trench the accident occurred in the notchlike trench excavated into the cut in the old fill the trench was cut into a nearvertical  feet vertical to  foot horizontal bench face the vertical sides of the trench were about  feet high at the left side of the trench  to  feet high on the right side and the trench was  feet wide the floor of the trench extended horizontally into the slope for about  to  feet then sloped steeply for approximately  feet and became vertical for about  feet where it intersected the slope above apparently gamble was standing on the horizontal floor of the trench at the time of the collapse the accident occurred when a mass of material separated from the right trench wall and collapsed into the trench the material fell into the trench predominantly by toppling and to a lesser degree by sliding the volume of collapsed material was estimated to weigh about  to  tons a large portion of material collapsed in the form of cohesive bouldersized soil pieces the largest piece was  feet by  feet by  feet it came to rest with the surface that separated from the trench wall facing upwards suggesting predominantly toppling motion the next largest piece reportedly came to rest against the lower back of the victim pinning him against the large piece this smaller piece was approximately  feet by  feet by ï¿½ feet weighing approximately  pounds at the time of the collapse a nonvibratory selfpropelled sheepsfoot roller was compacting soil on the bench at the same elevation approximately  feet from the trench no other equipment was nearby that could have produced significant vibration the trench wall collapse was precipitated by the development of tension cracks in the unstable  to  feet high vertical trench wall the soil was moist but not saturated at the time of the collapse the ground surface at the top of the trench was covered with loose dry soil that may have concealed evidence of instability in the form of tension cracking at the ground surface unsupported vertical trench faces in soil are not normally regarded as stable training and experience clark gamble had ten years of experience all with this crew he and the other crew members had received training on may   in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following root cause was identified root cause management policies and procedures were inadequate and failed to ensure that persons could work safely at the reclamation site ground conditions which created a hazard were not taken down or supported before work or travel was permitted corrective action management should establish procedures to ensure that persons can safely work in the area of excavations management should monitor persons working in these areas to ensure that the policies and procedures are effective

overview james hull frontend loader operator age  was fatally injured on august   when rocks rolled and struck the frontend loader he was operating hull was removing rock material that a second frontend loader had dumped from an upper bench the accident occurred because standards and controls were inadequate and failed to establish procedures prohibiting entry into areas where ground conditions created hazards for work or travel the areas were not barricaded or posted to prevent extraction on the lower benches while mined materials were deposited from the upper benches failure to recognize the hazard of performing work near the falling rock material contributed to the accident general information the walstrum quarry a surface granite operation owned and operated by albert frei sons inc was located off interstate  one mile east of idaho springs clear creek county colorado the principal operating official was albert r frei jr president the mine normally operated two hour shifts a day five to six days a week total employment was twentyfive persons rock was mined from the quarry at multiple benches by drilling and blasting a frontend loader was used to deposit the shot rock over the highwall perimeter as the rock material from the upper bench was deposited over the highwall slope the benches below were filled to a natural angle of repose once the benches were filled the rock material typically reached the third bench where a second frontend loader would load the material and haul it to the primary crusher the rock material was crushed screened and stockpiled finished products were sold for use in the construction industry the last regular inspection of this mine was completed on september   description of the accident on the day of the accident james hull victim reported for work about  am his normal starting time his duties included feeding material into the plant hopper thomas reynolds quarry foreman told hull to clear the dropped rock in the south end of the east highwall on the third bench and blend it with the rock brought in from an offsite construction project when the south end was loaded out hull was to travel to the middle highwall and perform the same task while hull was working at the south end charles broad jr loader operator arrived on the upper bench in another frontend loader broad was hauling blasted material and depositing it over the highwall edge at the north end of the east highwall the dumped rock flowed about  feet to the third bench hull and broad were able to communicate with twoway radios onboard each loader a maintenance area was established adjacent to the east highwall on the day of the accident steven w lutz mechanic was at the maintenance area repairing the radio on a frontend loader and listened to the radio conversation between hull and broad hull asked broad to switch dump locations on the east highwall so hull could extract the material broad had been depositing off the north end broad agreed and followed a company procedure to show hull where he would start dumping the two loader operators confirmed the location and broad began depositing the rock material off the east highwall south dump broad radioed hull after he had dumped three buckets and asked hull if he was clear of the falling material hull responded that the dump location was well to the south of his location broad stated he had no other contact with hull after that lutz confirmed the conversation about  pm lutz was traveling nearby where hull had been loading and noticed hulls loader was not moving and the rear window was out lutz parked the loader he was operating ran to hulls loader and called frei to inform him hull was injured and to call for emergency medical assistance lutz and frei administered first aid until local emergency personnel arrived the victim was transported to a nearby medical center where he was pronounced dead cause of death was blunt force trauma investigation of the accident msha was notified of the accident at  pm on august   by a telephone call from albert r frei jr president to michael t dennehy supervisory special investigator an investigation was started the next day an order was issued under the provisions of section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of miners mshas accident investigators traveled to the mine made a physical inspection at the accident scene interviewed employees and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and employees discussion location of the accident the accident occurred at the toe of the east highwall on the third bench the east highwall consisted of several benches that started at the third bench and rose  feet to the fifth bench production cycle at the time of the accident active mining was being conducted at the southern end of the east highwall on the fifth bench blasted rock was being transported by frontend loader bucket to the north and south dumps approximately  feet apart the rock dumped from the fifth bench channeled to the third bench until a uniform bank of rock material was created once the benches were filled with rock material additional material slid fell or rolled down the bank by gravity to the lower benches the resulting bank of shot rock assumed the materials natural angle of repose of about  degrees the rock materials dumped over the bank in this manner generally flowed down to the third bench running out from the toe of the bank at the time of the accident the bank was approximately  feet high from the third bench a frontend loader moved the material approximately  feet to the jaw crusher and processing facilities although the equipment operators could not see each other they could communicate with radios located in the cabs of the frontend loaders each dump location had a channel running down the bank where most of the rock flowed rocks which were dumped at the north and south dump areas were observed out as far as  feet from the toe of the bank on the third bench in order to load out all of the deposited rock the loader on the third bench cleaned this area to the toe of the bank large rocks typically came to rest about  to  feet out from the bank in addition the rock spread laterally over a distance of more than  feet when deposited from each location there was no evidence that the loader cut into the toe of the bank or that there was any mass instability of the bank at the accident site numerous rocks were observed lying very loosely on the slope of the bank even when there was no mining activity at the top or bottom of the bank small rocks were observed rolling or sliding down the bank frontend loader the frontend loader involved in the accident was a  komatsu wa  with a  yard bucket and rated at  horse power the loader was  feet high  feet long with the bucket down and had a normal reach of  feet it was provided with a retractable three inch seat belt the examination of the loader found no defects that could have contributed to the accident when found by lutz the loader was in the reverse gear and the backup alarm activated before lutz arrived the frontend loader had backed away from the toe of the bank approximately  to  feet before stopping when the loader was turned off the transmission went to a park mode and the park brake set these features functioned automatically as required impact points to the exterior areas of the frontend loader were noted as follows on the frontend loader at the right lift boom on the right front fender which was bent down on the front edge on the roll over protective structure at the forward right corner the right top light was broken away and the lower right area of the forward windshield was damaged the right side hand rail was damaged inside the cab several areas also indicated contact the right side of the steering wheel the dashboard and the onboard boom control were damaged the top left corner of the left access door was damaged the forward windshield indicated two distinct points of contact the safety glass separated at the point of contact into two sections with one portion under the left front tire while the remainder was lying in the cab two rocks were found on the rear deck behind the cab during the investigation one rock estimated at  pounds had been removed during the rescue efforts and placed on the rear deck of the loader behind the broken rear window another rock estimated at  pounds lay on the engine cover contact patterns in the windshield and cab interior indicated the rock had passed through the cab before striking the right air cleaner cover and the right muffler before coming to rest both rocks were removed from the loader and matched to a larger rock on the ground south of the loader yellow paint matching the color of the wheel loader and the placement of the three rocks together indicated that the large rock had struck the loader and broke into three pieces environment on the day of the accident the skies were clear with a temperature of approximately  degrees fahrenheit a light rain had fallen earlier in the morning but did not contribute to the accident training and experience james hull had  years  weeks mining experience and had been employed at this mine for  years  weeks he had not received annual refresher training in accordance with  cfr part  root cause analysis a root cause analysis was conducted and the following causal factors were identified causal factor procedures had not been established that isolated areas where falling or sliding materials could create a hazard corrective actions management should develop and implement a policy requiring barricades or other devices that prohibit entry into areas where falling material create hazards to employees causal factor the victim failed to recognize the hazard associated with performing work near falling materials corrective action employees should be trained to stop look analyze and manage slam each task to evaluate possible hazards and ensure steps are taken to safely perform the task conclusion the accident occurred because standards and controls were inadequate and did not establish procedures prohibiting entry into areas where ground conditions created hazards for work or travel the areas were not barricaded or posted to prevent extraction on the lower benches while mined materials were deposited from the upper benches failure to recognize the hazard of performing work near the falling rock material contributed to the accident enforcement actions order no  was issued on august   under the provisions of section k of the mine act a fatal accident occurred at this operation on august   when a miner attempting to excavate material in a komatsu wa frontend loader to feed the plant primary was struck by a rock that rolled from the bench above from an undetermined position this order is issued to ensure the safety of all persons at this operation it prohibits all activity beneath the highwalls and pull points in the mine until msha has determined that it is safe to resume normal mining operations in the area the mine operator shall obtain prior approval from an authorized representative for all actions to recover andor resume operations in the affected area this order was terminated on september   conditions that contributed to the accident have been corrected and operations can resume citation no  was issued under the provisions of section a of the mine act for a violation of  a fatal accident occurred on august   when a frontend loader operator was struck by rock at the quarrys east bank the loader was operating at the base of the bank when the accident occurred ground conditions in this area created a hazard to miners working and traveling in this area of the rd level this area was not posted with a warning sign or barricaded to impede unauthorized entry this citation was terminated
